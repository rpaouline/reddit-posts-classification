She hadn‚Äôt been home in about a week so last night I went looking for her and I found her at the house next to the abandoned one.

202,"So, we have a 3 y/o cat, Luna who's eating habits have been changing over the 2+ years since we got her. She went from eating anything and finishing all of it to becoming picky and leaving food behind in her bowl, especially dry food. She always loved her wet food and didn't have issues until the past two months but since we switched to a brand she likes, she's been doing fine with the wet. 

The remaining issue is the dry food. We feed her a 1/4 cup of kibble in the morning and she's been getting 3 oz of wet food in the evening. Lately, she's been leaving around half of the kibble, sometimes she eats a few bites more. I don't believe in free feeding so I dump whatever she doesn't finish.

So the question is, am I just feeding her too much kibble in the morning? She actually hasn't lost weight but in fact gained 5 ounces in the past half year. It just seems she's getting such little food albeit she isn't an active cat at all. I guess I am just curious if this is a common thing with cats and should I really be concerned? Should I look into finding a new brand of dry food? We have another cat that eats the same amount, is smaller in size, much more active and he acts like he's starving even after scarfing down his food.

I forgot to mention that Luna is on Prednisolone long term for her skin allergy. We have always been told by vets that it would cause an increased appetite but it's been the opposite.",Cat doesn't finish dry food all at once,cats

241,"my 1 year old cat lily was diagnosed with asthma a month ago
sunday, trouble breathing, vet says she likely has congestive heart failure. needs echocardiograham and ekgs done (can‚Äôt be done until thursday) to know the best treatment and more accurate prognosis.
she has syrup to get the fluid out of her lungs and a medication for her heart. yesterday i could see all the veins on her back paw pads and she felt hot and was twitching in her sleep and when she woke up. rushed to the vet and they said she was completely stable. i had them do another x ray and her heart has gotten worse. there‚Äôs an enlarged vein that was normal sized before. they gave her more syrup and said she really needs to see a cardiologist and not to consider euthanasia yet...

here is where i‚Äôm conflicted. if she does have 6 months - 1 year left, that time could be alright quality but would also be filled with emergency vet visits if something seems off, x rays all the time, meds with side effects, etc. 
i feel in my heart that she won‚Äôt have a good prognosis because 1. she is so young 2. this developed within a month or less (x ray 1 month ago, exam 2 weeks ago) 3. she got worse within a day. 
the vet said she got worse bc she needed higher doses of meds.
the main thing i am considering is that she‚Äôs at a very high chance for an extremely sudden and painful death. her last moments may very well be me dragging her into the car trying not to pass out and not even making it to the vet in time while she screams in pain. i feel that the chance of all these things happening is not worth sacrificing a peaceful end for her.
we are seeing an internist thursday because the only cardiologists are far away and mostly booked up. they still recommend i take her to a cardiologist ASAP and i am trying to..

one other factor is that if this is genetic, there is a small chance that her sister has the same condition but milder. so her sister will also need x rays, internist (closer), and cardiologist visits ASAP. add all this up and the costs are quite astronomical. my dad wants to do everything we can and keep trying. the vets say to keep trying. but my heart is telling me there is too much working against us. last year my baby had a very sudden and painful death at the vet and if i could take that back i would.

edit update: the cardiologist an hour away wants to see her today at 4. so like 8 hours from now. if she worsens before then i won‚Äôt take her. if she stays stable i think it‚Äôs worth the risk because they may be able to help her and me waiting to bring her in is just making it harder and harder.

244,"Hi there! :)I'm the happy owner of a 6 years old male Cat, living with me since he was born! He's always been an ""indoor-Cat"" as we are not allowed to build cat ladders outside the house and the surroundings are just too dangerous. As I'm moving into my own flat with the cat (I lived with my parents) I'm thinking about getting a second one so that my Cat is not home alone when I need to work.

What do you recommend me to do? Is there any difference in getting a male or female cat? Is getting a young cat a bad idea or doesnt that matter?

Anything else that I definitely should keep in mind?

She doesn‚Äôt sleep on my bed anymore, when she was a kitten she would sleep on my pillow. She doesn‚Äôt purr anymore unless she‚Äôs eating. The only time she wants anything to do with me is when she‚Äôs hungry or if I have milk. When I pet her there‚Äôs a 50% chance she‚Äôll bite me and a 50% chance she‚Äôll lick me. When she bites, it‚Äôs a playful bite. Usually she bites me and then licks my hand, and when I start to pull my hand away, she bites it and then licks it more. 

The only nice thing she does is she waits by the door for everyone to get home. 

Do you think she‚Äôll start liking me more if I rub catnip on myself? 

Is this just her personality? Is there a way that I can change it?

261,"We have a 5 year old cat named Oliver who we got when he was about 6 months old from an old professor. The prof's wife had taken Oliver's mother, a stray, in because she was pregnant and they found homes for all the kittens. Oliver has always been on the aggressive side, and throughout his life we have had issues with him 'hunting' us, making it stressful just to walk around our apartment, and when he attacks he pursues--he doesn't just bite or scratch, but he goes at us with a lot of power and hangs on until we can throw him off.

Last summer we fostered a puppy who'd been rescued from a drain pipe and was in really bad shape. We spent months getting him healthy, and they were kept separated the whole time--Louie (the pup) stayed in our room and Oliver wasn't allowed in for about 8 weeks. We didn't expect to keep Louie but ended up falling madly in love and adopting him. Louie is a rat terrior/italian greyhound mix so about 20lbs and skinny--Oliver's about 18lbs, a little on the big side for a cat.

Louie and Oliver usually just leave each other alone, but we sometimes catch Oliver 'hunting' Louie and always have to intervene. When we do go get something from the kitchen for a second and leave them alone together--well sometimes nothing happens, and sometimes Oliver attacks Louie. He's given him plenty of scratches, and once (although it was an accident) he scratched Louie's cornea.

My fiancee and I love both our guys, but we admit that Oliver has been really difficult to handle and makes life very stressful. I've had a lot of cats while growing up and none behaved like this. Has anyone had a particularly aggressive cat and found something that helped him calm down? We don't want to give him away--I honestly can't imagine doing something like that--but for our mental health and Louie's safety, we need to find a solution.

I'd really love to just hear from people who have advice to offer. I know there are things to point out about what we could've/should've done at some point before now but believe me, I've already beat myself up for a lot of stuff when it comes to how this whole situation has come about.",Looking for advice on my cat's behavioral issues,cats

269,"So Ive had Phoebe for four years now and feel like I know her fairly well. She is big snuggly long hair with a gluttonous streak. Most of the time she just sleeps constantly and doesnt really like to move much except for during feeding time. We feed her a portioned meal twice a day from one of those ball puzzles she has to roll around and she meows like crazy when I'm filling it up. 

However those meows have magnified. She has began meowing at the top of her lungs from sun up to sun down. It started just at night right before we went to bed but now its just constant and she paces the house back and forth. Its like she's in heat except she is fixed and has been for a very long time. Last night I woke up to her banging the kitchen cabinets trying to get into one and she continued doing so all night every time I left. 

I have no idea whats going on or what to do to stop her. Ive even gone so far as to using a spray bottle on her but apparently this ruckus is worth it to her because as soon as I go to lay back down she is right back at it again. Isolating her doesnt work either because she rips the door up and screams at the treshhold. 

I cant continue to do this, Im losing hours and hours of sleep and going mad. If this goes on any longer I will have to rehome her somehow or likely surrender her to the local shelter. ",What's up with my cat!? I'm getting desperate.,cats

463,"Hi! I have an issue with my cats that Im hoping someone has an answer to.

So me and my husband have 2 cats. 1 is 13 and our other is 3 and both are fixed. They get along okay too. They dont sleep beside eachother or any of that stuff but they do play together and eat beside eachother. Our roomate has a kitten and shes a year old now. Around the time the new kitten was introduced I have noticed an insane amount of pee all over the house. On the couch, my tv, the carpet, shoes, dinning table, folded towels in the bathroom, dirty laundry, closets, literally anywere. I remember thinking this is enough. I clean pee everyday and do their litters. Since noticing this issue I cant catch what cat is doing all the messes. Ive seen my 3 year old pee on my dining table. Thats it. Since this mess I have put 5 different litters in different places in my house. I also keep them in the basement were there is our family room, bar, laundry room, a bedroom and our back door. I keep the upstairs cat free for now. (Only since having my baby and not wanting piss on her crib or her toys. And good thing I did because the one night the door was left open and our oldest cat came upstairs, went in our babys room and slept under the crib. She had also pissed in her closet.)

I stil find pee in all sorts of areas. I do the litter every fucking day. I can tell you its a behavior issue and not medical. They all are healthy and seam fine nothing unusual. Just the peeing all over my house is making me so upset. Ive tried every cleaner on the market. Ive tryed making products myself. Today there was cat pee on my washer. Why could they be doing this? Is it all of them? Just 1? Ive tried different litters, different boxes. Its very frusterating. I have some things stored under our stairs and its all COVERED in urine. Like covered. Everything. Christmas tree. Our old dresser and mirror. Shoes. Evveerryytthhiinnggg has urine.

Has anyone else had this issue? what is the problem? why are they peeing? what do I do???? And our roomates cat is just over a year and not fixed. Im sure that doesnt help.

Ive taped down aluminum foil in the areas they have been pissing. so far success. no pee in thoes areas. wich make me think were else are they peeing.....heellpp",Any advice?,cats

478,"- He's healthy. Just had bloodwork last week to get to the bottom of this.
- No, he is not declawed.
- We have one other cat, who he grew up with. They get along.
- His routine has not changed in a couple of years.
- He's always been a very friendly, easygoing cat... until recently.
- He's neutered, indoor-only, always has been.

The biting is becoming a HUGE problem. It's not gentle ""love bites,"" it's full-on puncture wounds. He doesn't act aggressive when he does it, and there are no warnings -- no flattened ears, no tail whips, no enlarged pupils, etc. He only does it when he's annoyed or feeling bossy, such as if we stop petting him and he didn't think he'd had enough attention, or move our feet near him on the bed, or are taking too long getting his food ready. He bit my partner so severely a few nights ago that she had to go to the hospital.

I have no idea why he's doing this. It's been going on for a few months and getting progressively worse. At this point we're trying to keep him out of the bedroom, which is difficult in our apartment (there's no bedroom door, it's a studio loft).

Any advice other than spraying him when he does it, which doesn't seem to help?","8-year-old healthy cat has been biting us whenever we do something he doesn't like, such as not petting him.",cats

499,"Hello everyone, my SO and I have moved out of my grandmother's house recently, and decided it was a good time to adopt our own kittens (finally). We were going to adopt only a female, but since the shelter had a brother and a sister, along with a little pressure from my coworkers, we decided to adopt them both.

What a great decision that was, they play a lot, they teach each other how not to play too hard, we are loving them a lot and they're beginning to ask for scratches, man it feels amazing finally being able to love a pet.

The male, however, decided to piss on my stuff. I don't know if me being a man makes a difference, but he peed on my socks which I left on the floor, he dropped my still wet towel from the hanger and pissed on it. He pissed on a t-shirt of mine which he also took down from a hanger. The worst is actually pissing on our blanket, three times already. We washed it twice already on our washing machine, with softeners, cleaners etc. However he just decides to go on it. The third time was a few minutes ago, the blanket still drying on a different place than our bed. 

I love the little guys, I know that this is just temporary and he isn't responsible for doing this, but this can be avoided. They are about two months old, and aren't neutered yet. I don't want them not on our beds, we really enjoy them sleeping with us. They have two litter boxes, one in a bedroom and another in ours, we put it there to see if he'd stop (he didn't, though he uses it often).

528,"Hi everyone!

Cross posting from /r/pets as it might make more sense here. My GF and I have one sweet kitty, about a year and a half old. We adopted her from our local shelter, and she's a total sweetheart.

Now, we want a friend for her! We're both aware of finding a similar style cat (she's fairly calm, we were told she was shy and was actually bullied at the shelter), so we're aware of that. It's the introductions that I'm concerned about. All of the materials I've found surrounding this often assume that it's a multiple bedroom situation. We've got a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom apartment. Our cat sleeps in our bed every night with us, and hangs out in the bedroom about 70% of the time. I'm worried that introducing a new cat will cause her to hate us, since we'd have to use that bedroom as the new cats temporary territory. Essentially, we'd have to kick her out for however long it takes for them to warm up to each other, and that makes me slightly anxious. I don't want our current cat to hate us!

Does anyone have any advice on this, specifically introducing two cats in a small space? I've toyed around with the idea of sleeping in the living room with our cat myself while we introduce them. I've seen people mention using the bathroom, but honestly, the bathroom is pretty small, and having another cat in there might render it entirely unusable. For reference, our apartment is about ~700 sq ft.

597,"Hello! First off I want to say thank you for reading this. 

Okay, so my SO‚Äôs mom has an older cat named Marley who is just so sweet, and has a crooked tail. She used to be an indoor cat but she started to have accidents all over, I‚Äôm pretty sure because of age. She looks permanently malnourished no matter what they feed her. I personally have said many times I think she needs to be taken to the vet because she looks ill. But it has gotten to the point that my SO‚Äôs mom gets so rude if I even bring up the cats well being.
When I go over to her house I feed her and clean her water bowl and such. Give her lots of attention. The main worry of mine at the moment is how cold it is getting. Poor Marley doesn‚Äôt really have anywhere to go for warmth and her coat doesn‚Äôt thicken up like it should anymore. Is there a way I can help keep her warm in the fall/ early winter months? His mom won‚Äôt let Marley inside until it starts snowing. 
My SO and I aren‚Äôt in a stable enough place financially to really care for an animal or else I would volunteer to take her and care for her, but I am trying to do the best I can. 
I looked online and the heated pet beds for outside are just way too much money. So any suggestions that could be done for extremely cheap I am all game. I just want her to be comfortable until she gets to go inside for the harsh winter months. ",Worried about an older ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù cat,cats

I have a senior kitty (16, female, calico, tripod) who's dental hygiene needs some work. She is my family cat who I've recently taken care of so reassessing her health needs a bit.

She's recently had some dental work done due to degradation of some of her teeth and the vet has advised she needs a lot more attention in that department.

My only problem is, SHE DOESN'T CHEW HER BISCUITS. I've bought her tartar control dry food and dental chews specifically for cleaning. But she just swallows everything whole. 

I can't really book her into the vet for regular dental cleans because she has to go under sedation which is a huge ordeal and because well money.

So I'm hoping someone has some advice on what I can do to help her clean her teeth. She's old and grumpy so I can't imagine she would tolerate me brushing her teeth and I don't know how she would go eating large (like dog size) biscuits.

My cat, Artemis, has recently begun peeing on our couches. The first time it happened, it was just after we moved the litter box to the basement. I thought that maybe she was upset about her litter box being moved, so I moved it back to where it was. But today, she peed on the couch. My mother washed the cover and used bleach in an effort to mask the scent. After putting the cover back on, my cat peed on the couch (in the same spot!) once more. 

Why might she be doing this? How can I stop it? She was just at the vet last Tuesday, so I don't think it could be a medical issue.

Lately I‚Äôve been worried about him wearing a collar all the time. I‚Äôve been taking it off at night but I‚Äôm worried now because you can obviously tell where the collar was. His fur is extremely short in the front of his neck but fine on the back.

I have very small hands. Two of my fingers is approximately one persons regular sized finger so I always make sure all 5 of fingers can fit through so it wasn‚Äôt tight and I‚Äôd check this regularly.

Is this normal or something that happens? I‚Äôve taken his collar off in hopes that his fur with grow back fully again. But I‚Äôd like him to wear a collar again in a month or so when we go to move and he‚Äôs an indoor/outdoor cat. 

He doesn‚Äôt seem to have any skin issues. And its not bare in that area just stupidly short hairs compared to the rest of his fur.

737,"My baby girl, Lily, is 1 years old and had some coughing issues. I researched on my own and saw it looked exactly like cats who are having an asthma attack. She was diagnosed with asthma and the vet and we‚Äôve done everything to keep her from having attacks. She had an x ray for this a month ago. She only had 1-2 attacks since then.
On Sunday afternoon I came home and noticed her breathing was off. Took her to the emergency vet and they gave oxygen and x rays and said she has a slightly enlarged heart and fluid around/in(?) her lungs. Suspected congenistive heart failure. From what I‚Äôve read she is in stage 4 - labored breathing, some raspiness, tires easily, etc. She was given meds to manage this and I took her home because I had a cat emergency last year which ended up with 3 days of specialists, scared &amp; alone, no answers, &amp; sudden death as soon as I arrived (died in my arms when I came to see her). So, she‚Äôs been home and saw her primary vet this morning. He said she needs to see a cardiologist. Appt for that is today at 3pm but it‚Äôs an hour away. I hope she can take the stress of the long car ride. 
She gets up every couple hours or so and eats a little and drinks a tiny bit and wants to play so badly but I try to keep her calm. She seems fairly happy. 
I have been seriously considering in home euthanasia because of the risks she is facing right now- sudden heart attack, respiratory attack, clots, etc. which are extremely painful and traumatic. I‚Äôve read they can last an hour and the vet told me when &amp; if this occurs there is nothing I can do other than hold her. I‚Äôm hoping by 3pm she is still stabilized but if she begins to decline should I call an in home service? At this point the vet said no, give her a chance and let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs going on and how treatable it is. But I‚Äôm terrified for her to have a sudden and extremely painful death.",Asthma &amp; Congestive Heart Failure,cats

742,"Hi, so I have this cat that found my parked car in a rainstorm last year so I brought her home and she is an inside/outside cat. We did litter train her and it was going fine but when we saw that she liked going outside, we thought it would be best to let her sleep outside and during the day if one of us is home, she can come in and out as she pleases. 

Lately when I put her out at the end of the night, she hisses on the top step. She is facing outward to the yard, not to me, so I am curious if she is showing she is unhappy being outside, or just warning any potential cats lurking that shes not going to take their shit. There are other cats that show up time to time on our land, but we never fed those and they were always skittish around us. She has come back with a little scratch here or there before, the vet gave her a clean bill of health the first time and told us we neednt bring her in for such piddly battle wounds so long as they arent visibly dirty/infected

I guess my question is whether she is hissing at not wanting to go out anymore or hissing at potential cats/raccoons/armadillos about?",Curious to see if this is a normal cat reaction,cats

My parents and therapist think I should get a cat, but I'm not sure. I love cats, I love all animals, but I don't know if it would be too overwhelming to take care of one. Even with my rats I'll admit I wasn't the best owner to them sometimes because I just get too depressed to keep up with stuff and my main coping mechanism is avoidance. Will having a cat help me, or are they a lot more work than they seem? My first priority is to give any animals a good home. I don't want to have to return anyone to the shelter because I'm a piece of shit who never follows through on anything worthwhile. But I also have zero friends now, which makes me cry a lot. It would be really something to come home to an apartment that isn't cold and devoid of life. I could use some advice from people who know cats firsthand.

When we added the bracketed title tags several years ago, we made a [Vent] tag. The purpose of the tag was to set expectations for the reader, signifying that the post could be full of angry/upset emotions and tensions would be high. It became one of the most popular tags.

Rants about off-leash dogs and dog park shenanigans dominated. We had many of these posts each day, some piggy-backing off another [Vent] from earlier. The [Vent] posts often became hotbeds of inflammatory comments, fighting, and all the other bad parts of Internet forums. The number and quality of [Vent]s actually made our community less appealing as a whole.  They were, in short, a real problem. 

About a year ago, we decided to lock [Vent] posts automatically and they could be unlocked by messaging the mods, which is the state that they're in today. We screwed up and didn't ask the community before implementing this change--something which I am still very sorry about. I will not make that mistake again. We were optimistic that it would fix some of the problems we were having. And it did, to an extent!   There are a number of problems with the autolocking [Vent] posts, and I feel that we can improve the system.  

**Pros:** 

* We began to see significantly fewer repetitive posts. 

* There are fewer [Vent] posts in general.

* The mods have to personally handle each [Vent] post that allowed commenting, so we are more aware of problematic posts before they became problematic. 

* Comments occur only when the user specifically wants to have a conversation about their experience, which brings the average quality and value of the [Vent] posts up.

* Some users posted meaningful, quality [Vent] posts when they otherwise would not have. Avoiding comments gave them the ability to post.

**Cons:** 

* /r/dogs is a discussion-based subreddit and automatically blocking discussion goes against that purpose.

* Users often fail to understand the rules and do not message the moderators when they want the post open for comments, frustrating both the OP and potential commenters. 

* Users have occasionally abused the [Vent] tag as a criticism-free soapbox to share their opinions on non-personal topics.  

* Users find it extremely frustrating when they are blocked from commenting on a post by default. 

We had a bot in the works that would help us get the moderation benefits of the autolock rule, but it failed for unrelated reasons. We went back to the drawing board and we have some proposals for you. 

1. Making autolock opt-in instead of opt-out with moderator approval.  On all new [Vent] posts, there will be an Automod message saying something like, ‚Äúmessage the moderators to lock this post at any time"". 

2. A new tag that people can put on to make it auto-lock upon posting. Basically, instead of [Vent][Discussion] to unlock, [Vent][Lock] will auto-lock. The [Lock] tag would be for personal experiences only so that the mods can unlock any posts that don't fit that criteria. This is another version of opt-in, but provides a way for shy users to post with autolock, rather than having the post be up and waiting for the mods to respond to a request. When I was surveying people who chose to keep their posts locked, some of them responded they probably wouldn't have posted if it wasn't autolocked, and they were good posts. So, I see some value in preserving the autolock in some way.

What do you think of some type of opt-in system instead of opt-out? What are your ideas for revising the autolock rule?

885,"Edit: guys, please be nice. This is a hard time for me and I‚Äôve already learned to not buy from Craigslist again. I don‚Äôt need a lecture from everyone in the comments. And I made the soonest possible appt for him at the vet. I wanted to bring him in that same day but there weren‚Äôt any open spots.

Listen. I know I‚Äôm an idiot. Let‚Äôs get that out of the way. I had been roaming dog shelters for months searching for the perfect dog but never found the one. Who can resist adorable puppies on Craigslist?

All of these events have occurred in the last 48 hours.
 
I‚Äôve been wanting a dog my entire life. My dad doesn‚Äôt like dogs, so my dream was never fulfilled. During college, I ended up adopting two cats to try to fill the hole in my heart. It mostly worked. I recently became a dog groomer, which only fueled my desire for a dog. Yesterday, I gave in and bought the most adorable little border collie from a guy on Craigslist. Initially, he looked okay. He was very skinny but I figured his last owner didn‚Äôt feed him enough. I bought him high calorie paste that I force fed him. He was also covered in fleas, but a thorough flea bath, flea medication, and manual flea removal did the trick. We had a vet appointment set up for tomorrow to get him a check up and shots.

We noticed after a while that all he did was sleep. He ate a little at first, but not again after the initial feeding. He drank well. His poop was watery, but I know that‚Äôs normal for puppies for the most part. He was a sweet guy, he would climb up my torso and fall asleep in the crook of my neck. 

A few hours ago, he threw up a massive amount of water..... with worms in it. We rushed him to the only vet that was still open. After a few tests, we learned that he had a severe infection, labored breathing, two types of worms, was dehydrated, and anemic. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing some too. The vet told us there was a small chance he would recover even with hospitalization. Treatment is expensive, and likely would only prolong his suffering, so we wanted to go the euthanization route. Before we could do so, a vet tech working in the back offered to transfer ownership and try to treat him. We knew he would be in good hands and this was likely the best option for him. 

I am currently sitting in a puddle of my own tears, with my eyes so swollen they can barely open. The previous owner had supposedly dewormed him (wrong), told me him and his littermates/parents are healthy (wrong), told me he was healthy (wrong), told me he was 8 weeks old (wrong - the vet said more like 6-7 weeks) and won‚Äôt answer my texts. I ended up spending roughly $800 on this little guy (edit: $300 on the dog, $500 on supplies and vet bills) and we never even treated him.   Moral of the story is....... don‚Äôt buy puppies from people without dog papers. Especially when they live in the middle of nowhere and look like the stereotypical Craigslist Killer.

A local art gallery had a sale for commissioned paintings and I really wanted one done so badly. I love the painting so much. I chose an autumn-y, sunset background because in my mind, when I go to Heaven, it would be a place that was warm and golden, and I would spend the rest of eternity chasing my dogs among tall grass and reeds.

887,"*Lycaon Pictus,* better known as painted dogs, African wild dog or painted wolves, split off from the line which eventually produced domestic dogs a very long time ago. They show a lot of typical canid characteristics like their amazing social interaction for example and of course, like most dogs, they are pretty intelligent. They are however also ferocious hunters and were regarded as pests which has brought them to the brink of extinction with only about 5-7k left in the wild. Interestingly, despite their reputation as hunters, there are no known attacks on humans in the wild.

Watching one of these dogs run is not dissimilar to watching a sheep dog or a springer spaniel going full belt - so fast yet still agile - simply amazing - but chasing single-mindedly like that means they often get caught in snares set for their prey. As the others won't just leave their injured family member, they might fall victim to other snares set in the vicinity.

All the dogs have individual markings so those that are monitored by conservation groups all have names. I was lucky to see a tracking collar being fitted on a young female whilst visiting [Painted Dog Conservation](https://www.painteddog.org/new-folder/) in Zimbabwe. Her name was Moonbeam and she had the most beautiful markings. Three months later I heard that Moonbeam and her entire pack had succumbed to rabies. It was heart-breaking.

Other canid diseases like distemper are also causing fatalities. In the case of Moonbeam and her pack, there would have likely been more casualties all-round, had [WildlifeVets International](https://www.wildlifevetsinternational.org/projects/african-painted-dogs) not run vaccination clinics in the area for the local domestic dog population for a number of years to try and stem the spread of these terrible enemies.

Puppies often fall foul of lions or hyenas and it is rare that an entire litter survives to adulthood.

If you are interested and want to find out more, please come and visit us on /r/PaintedWolves. We chose the name as that is the translation of their Latin name but also as it is the name the BBC have chosen for them in their upcoming new series 'Dynasties' about endangered species (see [the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWI1eCbksdE&amp;feature=youtu.be)). The sole aim of the sub is to help save these amazing animals by raising awareness of their plight and support efforts by groups and individuals more directly involved.

It would be fantastic if dog lovers everywhere would join in the fight for the survival of the African wild dog. Just telling everyone that no, African wild dogs are not related to hyenas would be a good start - thought they look totally different people do get them confused. Interestingly, hyenas are distant members of the cat family and the relationship between them and the dogs is not that dissimilar to domestic cats and dogs in many ways.

Are you interested in their survival or do you feel that as the apex of dangerous breeds they should be left to die out? Have you had any encounters with them in the wild or in captivity? Do you have suggestions how we might increase support for them? Do you have questions about the conservation efforts etc... All comments are useful in understanding how the public perceives these dogs.

If you are a friend of the wild dogs, we'd love to welcome you to the PaintedWolves pack :-)

888,"Ok probably not, but I was still touched as heck.  


I had just finished watching this Netflix show The Haunting of Hill House (highly recommended), and was crying like a baby.  I don't cry often and the last time I did, my dog looked at me like I was more annoying than anything.   He also walked away and left the room, lol.  


Last night we were both on the sofa while I finished watchingthe show, and when I bent down to hug him with my tear-stained cheeks, the little guy actually sniffed my face then licked away my tears.  I thought dogs only did this in movies or books; it was super corny but he did it - and it made me cry even more...lol.    


I had to put him to bed after which then made me feel bad (he loves going to bed, I'm just overly dramatic) and today I'm just thinking about my sweet little dude and how great dogs are.   I assume dogs lick tears because they are salty, and not because they're like ""there there, human.  It'll be ok"" but it's still nice to think about.

Last Wednesday, we sent our beloved Sora onto her next adventure at the Rainbow Bridge.

For the last four years, we've lived by the motto: If we go, they go. This means that we bring our dogs everywhere we go, including a two year bicycle tour across Europe and South America where Sora came along.

Sora traveled with us to 29 countries on three continents. We had hotel doors slammed in our faces, people who wouldn't accept us because we had our dog, we struggled with the extra weight and constantly dealt with border paperwork for Sora, and we missed out on a lot of ""must-visit"" destinations because they are not dog-friendly.

In exchange, we made thousands of people smile around the world, found amazing locations to visit practically free of other tourists, we showed people how animals can be members of a family, and most of all, developed a bond so thick that we ensured that all of our adventures going forward included Sora. If it wasn't dog-friendly, we found something else to do.

My hope and dream is that our travels with Sora inspire you to take your own dogs along on your adventures, no matter how near or far, big or small. It's not always easy, but it is always worth it.

893,"Growing up in the '80s, my family had dogs and cats. I can remember punishment methods being used back then, such as rubbing their nose in messes, swatting with newspapers, etc., and that feeling normal at the time.

Two months ago (to the date, actually), my husband and I adopted a 10 week old puppy from a no-kill shelter. He was generally pretty happy once we got him home. He takes to training really well as he is incredibly treat motivated (even if he seems to be disinterested in his regular puppy food sometimes, treats will always get him eager). Accidents are already scarce in the house, unless we put him in his crate (which, admittedly, we probably didn't train properly on and still have confusion as to how to properly crate train -- we're tempted to get the Crate Games DVD I've seen recommended on here previously).

However, before I got him (and even still), I was incredibly nervous as this was my first dog ever that was mine, so I was scouring every website I possibly could. I started having stress dreams that I was irreparably ruining my dog and turning him into an aggressive dog, or a withdrawn, scared dog. I realized that my mother was still doing negative training on her dogs and was suggesting the same to me. She uses the crate as a punishment, she still puts noses in messes, immediately jumps to raising her voice to her dog to get them to listen, etc. When she suggested I do the same to my dog, I said I would not and said things had changed in understanding canine behavior since the '80s (or '70s) when she learned more negative reinforcement/dominance theory towards dog raising.

But, even though I made a conscious decision to try and raise in positive ways, I still found myself accidentally slipping into things that I was raised around. If the puppy started having an accident in the house, I shouted and made him afraid of me. If he mouthed my hand, I held his muzzle shut (thank you, Cesar's Way, for that trash training advice -- I chalk that up to being so wracked with anxiety over raising this puppy right, I listened to almost any ""expert"" opinion). If he tried to squirm away from having his muzzle held shut, I pinned him to make sure the ""corrective behavior"" was done successfully. If he was getting into trouble, I was stomping my feet to try and disrupt the behavior, and it even made him submissively urinate once. My puppy has been genuinely fearful of me more than once since I got him, and I was letting the negative training habits I was raised seeing my pets get as a child come out.

Once I recognized this problem, I've been making a more concentrated effort to rein it in. The puppy seems less fearful towards me, but still somewhat cautious. He'll come when called, he sleeps with either me or my husband on the couch (we want a longer gap between accidents before we introduce him to the bed, and he just cries all night if we try putting him in his crate). But I still can't help but feel like I damaged his bond with me.

So, for the help, is there a way to help rebuild and repair that bond between the puppy and I? We've already enrolled him in the full set of puppy/adult/Canine Good Citizen training at our local US-chain pet supply shop, and we're sticking to what they've said (with the exception of not yelping -- when he gets worked up and bitey with hands, that's the only thing that works to inhibit him and get him to be more gentle when returning to play). He seems to have no problem with my husband (though he gets more aggressive with the biting with him -- not piercing skin, but relentless to the point that yelping, redirecting, sitting on hands/feet, etc. just don't dissuade him). We're committed to giving the puppy a great life and a great home, despite the initial rough start, and any advice to help do that would be greatly appreciated.

On the discussion side of things, I was wondering if other people have had trouble with growing up around bad animal raising habits and that affecting their training/behavior around the dog, and, if so, what they've done to help reinforce positive methods and stop the negative ones in their interaction with puppies/dogs.",[Help][Discussion] Overcoming negative training habits you were raised with,dogs
894,"So, about 3 months ago I foster failed my 1.5year old,  75lb blue pit bull after falling in love with his amazing demeanor. I took him home with another foster, a 4 month old aussie mix. Took my time introducing them but was quick to find out he loved other dogs. The puppy was a sassy lady who often would snarl and snap at him as they were playing, He never reacted, usually would just sit on her in protest. They got along great, sharing toys, water bowl, and food. He also would go to the small dog park in my apartment complex and play with 6 other dogs. Including dogs that would mount him and show dominance. He never reacted at all. This included both before and after his neuter. He was such a good model for well behaved pits that I decided to adopt him. His one flaw thus far was going INSANE when someone came over. Jumping 3 feet in the air onto them, often injuring the person.

Well, 6 weeks ago he started barking for attention. It was annoying, but nothing too severe. We worked on it along with dropping toys with positive reinforcement. Didn't make too much progress. He was highly trainable in other areas but has zero impulse control. Fast forward to about 3 weeks ago when I moved to my new apartment. The barking had gotten worse at this point, occurring at least every 30 minutes if not more. He goes on 1-2 hour long walks almost daily. 7 days ago, my roommate morgan moved in. His barking and lunging/soft biting increased even more. No concept of personal space. Still not showing aggression towards dogs as he has met many from my new complex. Well...I volunteer for a rescue and there was a 6 month old female unspayed (for now) female that I took on. That's when he lost it. They have to be separated as he showed immediate object guarding, food aggression, and general aggression when trying to play. Then he moved on to snarling and snapping at both my roommate and I. At this point, unless he is fast asleep, he's barking, jumping, lunging, and chew/play biting but more towards the serious end non stop. I'm hunting for behaviorists right now, but could use some support/ideas in the meantime. He is very active and not lethargic or having any symptoms of a physical problem.

921,"I‚Äôve been taking my dog (lab/pit mix) to the same dog park for years and while on occasion he does show resource guarding (at which point I immediately take him home), he‚Äôs never bitten another dog with his rough play. I will admit that when he first enters the park and is still attached to his leash/full of energy he will growl at other dogs. But overall, my dog is the type of dog that prefers to play with humans and leaves other dogs alone except for the initial sniffing. However, my dog likes to be sort of a patrol dog and if two dogs are fighting he will immediately charge to the situation and bark at the one of the dogs to knock it off.

Today: A lady brought her husky in and at first everything was okay. About ~5 minutes later, two different dogs and this husky engaged in very rough play and had to be separated because they were snapping and wrestling each other. My dog comes in to break up the fight and I hear from the husky‚Äôs owner, ‚ÄúHere comes more trouble.‚Äù I‚Äôm sensitive about comments like these because of my dog‚Äôs pit side.

This happens a second time with the same dogs and my dog goes in and will not let the husky off the hook. He chases the other dog and growls at it.

He's about 10-11 years old (not for sure because we took him in as a stray) He was put on medication to help the coughing fits he would have (due to the heart pressing on the trachea making it difficult to breathe) he's been back to the vet a couple times since May because his coughing would get worse even on the medication. We'd get a higher dosage of medication and things would be fine for a few months, in till he'd start coughing more frequently again thus being put on an even higher dosage.

In August of this year he was given the highest dosage of medication that they can give him and it helped for awhile. It's now almost half way through October and even on the medication he's coughing more frequently and it sound so much worse than it did.

926,"Hey all,

I've had this mulling around in my mind for a couple months now, and wanted to get some of your thoughts. 

I'm really wanting to get a dog. I grew up having family dogs around, and I think it would be great to have one of my own now. The thing is, I've found that I don't actually want just any dog. 

You see, I grew up with poodles. I'm used to a dog that is rather chill around people, easy to train, and doesn't shed - at all. I'm used to poodles that were largely indoor animals, good for cuddling on the couch and general companionship. I'm used to petting a dog with hair, not fur. I find that whenever I pet some kind of other dog, the greasy, wiry coats, the ""dog smell"", furs ALL over the gods-damned place and the like make me very wary of getting anything other than a poodle, or in my most recent thoughts, a labradoodle. Honestly, life with a non-shedding breed with the energetic maturity of a 30 year-old human is very great, if you don't always have the energy to play fetch for 2 hours every single day.

My fiance however, grew up living with whatever came out of the pound, you know - rescued dogs.

I guess my expectations for what a ""dog"" is, and for what ""getting"" one is, are very specific. I expected that it's normal to go pick out a pup of some certain breed that's right for you, and then take responsibility for training it properly. Boom. Done. Mission accomplished.

This of course, is not what my SO has for her expectations. So her most recent suggestion for us both was framed as a compromise: we get both a poodle and some other dog that needs a home.

So here is the trouble, I feel that this is not much of a compromise for her, since getting a poodle and some other dog basically means my home will simply still have dog hair all over the place anyways. So then, what's the point in getting a poodle if the other dog is going to shed all over anyway? 

Well why still get a poodle then? Because I can chill with it on the couch with any shedding issues. Because the poodle is wicked smart, and easy to train, because it will lend to a more ""relaxed"" environment since it won't be a super-hyper high-energy monster that drools and knocks stuff off the coffee table every other minute. It just won't. Again, I grew up with this breed, and their reputation goes beyond my own experiences with them.

But getting a second dog totally unlike a poodle ruins that whole vibe of the environment. Now the place will be crazy hairy, and maybe this other breed barks all the time and is an energic freak. 

I feel that if we JUST got a poodle, it would have less of an effect on her expectations since we still end up with a dog. It would be no different than if we just found a poodle at the pound, since we would have a dog, and the pound would still have tons of dogs filling the kennels.

But if we also get a crazy husky-shep-boxer mix thing, the whole situation is no different than where there is no poodle at all. And that's a situation with hair all over, more frustration in training and barking discipline and rules for the couch etc. It's just not what I want. If that's what having a dog is like, I'm honestly not interested. If that's the bar, then I wouldn't be so interested in dogs. But luckily, I know that not all breeds are identical.

I've lived with the other breeds when I've have many roommates in the last 8 years with cats, labs, Shepard's, huskies, boxers, bulls and terriers. I frankly don't think any of those dogs or I would be happy where I'm trying to maintain a relatively chill environment.

And yet I get this judgy vibe from people - like buying a pup goes against some set of ethical rules I don't know about. But I don't think it is very responsible to go and pick up just any breed to come home to live with you. I think it's VERY important to choose the breeding the dog Intentionally. 

By intention. As in, ""I MEANT to end up with a dog like this, and not that"". Or, ""I knew the probability of my dog of a certain breed would likely behave more like this, and not that"".

People sort of make me feel like I'm some kind of horrible monster that enables puppy milling or buying into the designer dog fad ( which in my opinion is not all that different from the selective breeding done over the centuries anyways).

So I offered this as a compromise to my SO: Why don't we just find a breed at the pound that doesn't shed? Well. We looked at those breeds, and they are either sort of rare (This of course, feeds my ego, since I don't find it likely that especially desirable breeds WOULD be found at the pound so frequently) or not ""cute"" at all.

Really??

I feel that such qualifications are VERY arbitrary and unearned. The qualifications for owning a poodle however, are well-known in the dog world, even if the process of acquiring a pup has a less.. ah, generous spirit to it than adopting has.

Thoughts? Where do you think I am possibly being rather - unreasonable here? 

Is it OK to pruchase a pup from a breeder since I know the sort of breed I want to live with? Or is that unethical since there many unadopted animals still waiting for homes? What if I don't actually believe that my adoption of a dog will actually decrease the number of these animals in need? 

Do you all think buying from a breeder is a selfish and unethical method of finding a dog? Is my current approach enough to suggest that maybe I shouldn't have a dog at all? My attitude is along the lines of: I'll love THIS dog, but definitely won't love that OTHER dog. This is a sad thing to realize, I think.",[Help][Discussion] Adopting vs Buying,dogs

929,"Hi everyone! Thank you for reading my post. Last week my puppy spent 4 nights and 5 days at a ‚Äúlodge and learn‚Äù puppy camp. The vet suggested it to help with separation anxiety along with his medications. 

While he was there he seemed to have a great time and loved all the workers and playing with other dogs.

When I went to pick him up they informed me that during his bath I had scheduled they found fleas, but told me that they went ahead and treated him. 

Saturday morning he was in my bed chewing a toy and I checked him out for any sores or bites from the fleas and realized he was still absolutely covered in fleas and had an open bleeding sore from a bite. 

I called the place and they said ‚Äúwe gave him a pill to make the fleas fall asleep and got off what we could with our fingers‚Äù
At first I was upset because that‚Äôs not treatment so don‚Äôt tell me you treated him. They were so casual about it I thought the problem was fixed, clearly they did very little.

This morning I woke up at 6 am to the sound of him coughing, hacking, and eventually vomiting a white froth. He did this several times until we got to the vet at 8 am. I mentioned it briefly while we were there and she gave me a prescription to pick up at Walgreens to help his tummy. I dropped him off at home and was off to the pharmacy.

By the time I got back he had white frothy vomit in his bed and he was extremely lethargic, so lethargic he peed himself. Not peed in his bed, he was still laying started crying and peed himself.

My dog ate a ton of palm seeds when a family member left her outside too long (live in FL). Not a poisonous kind, but because I didnt know what happened she probably didnt get the care she needed soon enough. Got home late that day and the dog started throwing up the next morning.  Had another long day of work and came home to a sick dog and felt terrible and irritated that no one noticed she wasnt feeling good. throwing up, refusing to eat, and no bowel movement. It was too late for the vet and I didnt know how bad it was and decided to take her to the vet the next day. Started out ok, she got an enigma and seemed to be doing fine. Then things got really bad.

Didnt think she could die, but I was notified at work the next day that there was major blockage and a risky surgery was the only chance. With the information I had I went to the emergency clinic thinking I was going to need to let her go because she was not doing good and surgery was $$$$. Called my brother and he meet me for support along with other family members. Dr gave us a slightly more hopeful scenery, but a costly and risky one. She is only 2 years old and after reading the room(how others felt) and asking the dr what he thought I went for the surgery. Already $1,500 gone, but at the moment I believed more $ was worth it. Surgery was successful and rough and her recovery has been mixed. They discovered some fluid today which might mean nothing, but also could be very bad. She has been back and forth to the vet and night emergency clinic since last Saturday. The costs are adding up and I want to literally throw up. If she doesnt make it I will feel terrible putting her threw this. Its a matter of her intestine healing correctly, because it could tear open. The Drs arent sure yet and she still has several days to before she ""makes it out of the woods""

The longer she needs professional support the more costly this is, but I feel like there is no returning at this point. I wont just take her home or let her go because of money, she could completely recover! I love this dog and have friends and family who are routing for her.

932,"Just found out someone I'm friends with does the 'keeping his dog caged for 20 hours a day thing'. He says the dog will bite and chew stuff if its left alone in his room during the day or night - I suggested training the dog, covering his valuables or putting a muzzle on the dog so he doesn't have to be in a cage, and his response was 'yeah, I could' (with a tone of 'but I won't'). He then said the dog would pee on stuff, so I suggested toilet training the dog or putting puppy pads down and training it to use those. Which he also isn't planning on doing. He gets home from work at 6pm, lets the dog out for 2 hours then puts it back at 8pm, so it doesn't wake up his roommate's daughter later as it barks/whines when it gets put back in the cage. He said sometimes his roommate will take it out of his cage when he's not there, but even with that, the dog would still be in the crate for about 20 hours a day (it sounds like the roommate works similar hours to him, and goes out alot, so I assume isn't at the house much more than him). Its just beyond weird to me. It just seems so creepy to have a large/complex animal that you store in a crate for months except for a couple hours a day when you want to play with them. I like the guy and enjoy his company, but I feel like a weirdo for being friends with someone who's doing this to animals. 

I tried mentioning to him that its weird, but he didn't really seem to care, I guess because I don't know that much about dogs. So I wanted to ask some people who love/know alot about dogs, if this is normal/fine, or if its animal cruelty, and if it is, what he can do to get to a better situation with his pet.


Edit: thanks for all the good advice, definitely a lot of things here I'm keen to try. I called animal protection today, they offered to do a welfare check - they said there's not a specific ordnance that being crated excessively violates, but they'd try to look at the dog's health/environment as a whole to see if they can make a case for animal cruelty. He just moved, so I need to get his address so they can do that - I'm going to speak to him a bit more, see if I can make progress, and if not, I'll give out his address so they can go over (if nothing else, it should get him to take the situation seriously). And if anyone is in the Hampton Roads, Virginia area and could offer any dog training/sitting services - for any amount of time - that could help. Its hard to make any progress because he just closes down and brushes me off whenever I bring it up, but I'm going to give a little bit more of a try then get animal protection to go over. He does recognize that he can't care for it, and is thinking giving the dog to his family over Christmas (they don't live nearby), my only concern is a) that's several more months of blehness for the dog and b) idk if his family will be equipped to deal with a dog that's untrained and traumatized from this.",[Help] Friend cages their dog for 20 hours a day,dogs

One day we were out with a friend , when I was in the back seat and noticed a small black puppy running headfirst towards our car, another car narrowly missing him! I told our friend to stop the car so I jumped out and grabbed the puppy, noticed that he looked horribly bloated yet skinny, and had lots Of scabs and missing hair , and he sat on my lap, just staring at me, not moving while I was stroking him. We took him to a vet that day and found out he had worms, ticks and demodectic mange, (which is why he doesnt have much fur in the photos that I will link below) . We paid for his treatment and some special food. We gave him medicinal baths and tried our best to nurse him back to strength. Me and my boyfriend decided a day later that he would be ours and we called him Tyson. We spent only a week and a half with him and got him as strong as we could for his stay in my mums friends shelter, where he was vaccinated, chipped and placed in quarantine before he comes back to us.

I sat down and began to peacefully enjoy my dinner and Netflix on the couch. She laid down in front of the couch and began to chew away. It was great because she's been a pain for the past few days (yay 7 month old puppy) and after 30 minutes of intense chewing there are barely teeth marks on it. 

And then, mid-bite, halfway through my dinner, the smell hit me like a slap in the face.

935,"So I have been fostering a dog for the last week and I am an out of state college student that just wanted to help out my local shelter and try to find this guy a home and train him a bit. I am already starting to get attached to him but definitely know that I can't adopt him myself because my life will be uncertain for these next few years. Since I will be traveling home for the holidays, the dog will need to stay at the shelter if he doesn't get adopted by then (unless I can find someone willing to withstand his lack of training for a month). Specifically, I will be leaving for 9 days for Thanksgiving, and also for a weekend before then. Christmas I will be gone from December 13 until just after New Year's. My question is, am I helping or hurting the dog by giving him a great time and then having to abandon him at the shelter? Would it be better for him to go back to his life at the shelter now while he is still used to it? They are a great shelter with a very high adoption rate and do as much as they can with what they have.

I have worked at adoption shelters for many years and recently decided to get my own dog. I only volunteered because I never felt like I had the time. I researched breeds, thought about why I want a dog, what I'm expecting, and whether I would be able to handle the responsibility. 

So I adopted a dog. After a few days the dog potties on command, stays in the kennel without a peep, sleeps most of the day, never barks, comes when asked. I can't think of how the dog can be more perfect. Everything I wanted the dog is. The things I envisioned happened, but I just not happy. Further during training exercises I think how happy the dog would make someone and this is a marketable trait to get adopted. I don't see the dog as mine. 

I know its only been a few days, and the dog appears to like me, but I just don't want a dog. I'm worried to keep it longer as I don't want to cause any further mental stress/anxiety in giving the dog up. Also fully aware I'm a crappy person. Just looking for feedback.

952,"**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. In my late teens I had 2 Maltese, a Yorkie and a half Chihuahua half Yorkie. Potty training and basic commands (sit, stay, recall) were the only training I did with them.

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

No preference, but I want a puppy so I can acclimate it to my cats and horse (if/when I take the dog to the barn with me).

1. Describe your ideal dog.

Loyal (has their own ""person""), likes to play and have fun but isn't overly energetic, obedient (will come when they have their name called), easy to train, affectionate but not overly clingy. A dog that will hang out with me while I binge Netflix for a few hours but will totally kill it when I grab a tennis ball and spend a few hours at the park just playing and running around with me. A dog with a relatively low prey drive so my cats will be safe. This is the biggest reason why I want a puppy, so they're exposed to cats early on. I adopted my cats and both were declawed when I got them, so they don't have much to defend themselves with.

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Shiba Inu - purely based on size - the more I research Shibas I understand they are very stubborn,  not easy to train, and not cuddly.

American Eskimo - similar reasons to Shiba - good size, not \*as\* stubborn as a Shiba.

Grate Dane - gentle giant, big with but low energy

Golden Retrievers - good size, affectionate, easy to train, but they can be very energetic

Labrador Retriever - same reasons as Goldens

French Bulldog - good size, super cute, low maintenance, lazy (possibly too lazy for my taste?)

Beagle - good size, cute, playful

7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

9.	What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large.

10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Eager-to-please.

14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Cautious optimism? I wouldn't my dog to be fearful of strangers, but I wouldn't want them to jump on them and start slobbering on their face.

15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No.

16.	Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression, high-prey drive, low recall, excessive barking.

18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

N/A

19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

I have 2 adult male cats. I have a horse who stays at a barn and ideally I would like my dog to be able to safely be around horses.

20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

No.

22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

USA, an hour and a half outside of Indianapolis. I am not aware of any laws banning certain breeds.

23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

Yes. No prior experience.

2. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I would ideally like to have a dog from a breeder (from birth). I have some worries about adopting a dog.

3. Describe your ideal dog.

¬∑ Minimal grooming maintenance, patient, attractive, friendly. Preferably minimal chance of health issues. Minimal shedding.

4. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

¬∑ I like the look of terriers (Norwich, Norfolk), Havanese, Min Pins, on a purely superficial level. I am not too familiar with the character traits of various breeds. Level of attractiveness is important to me, I find it hard to connect with dogs like greyhounds, chihuahuas that I don't find ""cute"".

5. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

¬∑Potty train. That's pretty much it.

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

¬∑ Perhaps 1-3 hours on weekdays, more on the weekends.

7. How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

¬∑ I can exercise it 2 hours a day (1 morning, 1 evening). I free up later at night, so if more than 1 hour is needed in one go, I can make time.

8. How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

¬∑ Really depends on how extensive the process is. I have the time in evenings on weekdays. But ideally wouldn't want it to be a regular thing. If I fall in love with the dog I will do it of course, no questions asked.

**Personal Preferences**

9) What size dog are you looking for?

¬∑ Small dog.

10. How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

¬∑ As little as possible of each.

11. How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

¬∑ I don't have a back yard (1 bed apartment in a condo), so this may be difficult. I live in Miami Beach fwiw. I guess there are places I could do it, but I worry about it running off and not coming back.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

¬∑ Middle of the road would be ideal. But I would lean closer to snuggly.

13. Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

¬∑ Eager to please

14. How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

¬∑ Don't mind a bark or two, but no excessive barking or jumping. Minimal aggression.

15. Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

¬∑ No.

16. Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

¬∑ ANY aggression, hyperactivity (and therefore bored too easily when I am out)

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

¬∑ I rise at 7.00am, in office from around 8.30/9am - 6pm. Theoretically I could take my dog to work (WeWork), especially at early stages, but I will have to manage my work environment accordingly. Weekends are completely free, unless I am seeing friends during the day or have an engagement in the evenings.

18. What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

¬∑ I live alone.

19. Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

¬∑ No pets, none planned.

20. Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

¬∑ No.

21. Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

¬∑I rent. Not sure what is on my lease.

22. What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

¬∑ I live in Miami Beach. FL. Not sure

23. What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

¬∑ 80s-high 90s F in the summer, 60s-70s in winter.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

¬∑ 25 yo single male, desk (phone based) job, active lifestyle which includes regular walking, running and weight training. I am looking to do my research properly and do not want to jump into getting a dog before I am completely committed.

I have a year and a half old Terrier mix named Millie that I adopted a couple of months ago. I just recently started working full time and close to home. 

However, I'm now gone for around several hours at a time and she has some sort of Separation Anxiety. I've tried to help her out by giving her a Kong in the morning. I'm also taking my lunch breaks to come home and play with her and take her for a walk. She also has a couple of chew toys and such that she can entertain herself with while I'm gone. However she still does some odd things that are very clearly driven from the separation anxiety.

 Up to this point it has been pretty harmless. I'll notice that she has moved some of my socks and/or shoes into my living room for example. Nothing destructive until now. 

Today I came back and discovered that my roommates shoes had been a little torn up on the inside.

965,"My beloved little rescue mutt just bit me. It was my fault, I feel very guilty that it came to this, but how can I do better next time?

So, I live in a flat, and if I cause even one noise complaint I'll be told to get rid of my little dog. I have a mental illness, and having this little ray of doggy sunshine in my life keeps me going, striving to be a good person and keep well. I love my dog to absolute pieces. I don't want to give him up.

I feel very guilty that when he barked in the echoey stairwell, I slapped his snout to stop the barking. I should not have done that; my dog Rupert told me so by biting my hand in response. And I know that I shouldn't resort to such things anyway. It was a kneejerk response; what response can I do, when I really need Rupert to be silent? It's like he gets himself so worked up, when he starts barking he won't stop for a good few minutes, though there is no threat/even after the threat has gone.

I'm unsure how I can teach him to be quiet when we are in the stairwell (noise really carries) and at other important times. I feel on edge myself most of the time worrying that he will bark and I just don't know how to proceed.

Rupert is getting better at responding when I need him to, but calming him down when he is barking seems impossible. He ignores all commands when he is barking. He will run about my flat barking as he goes; I try calling him to me and he never comes if he is too busy barking. When he is quiet he responds well to my commands, although he seems to be a slow learner.

So my questions are:

- how do I act to calm Rupert when he barks?
- what can I do when he barks and I really need him not to?
- how can I restore his trust? I feel so guilty that I resorted to trying to hurt him to make the barking stop.

Thank you for reading, I feel really lost in this.

Oh and Rupert is a mix breed, about 5-6kgs in weight (so pretty small) possibly chihuahua with yorkie or other terrier cross.

966,"My boyfriend and I have had our 15 month old terrier mix for about a year, and work opposite schedules so that she is alone for only 3-4 hours a day, four days a week. He now has the opportunity to shift his work schedule to standard hours, like myself, which would be great for us as we rarely see each other due to our conflicting schedules. However, this would mean our dog would be alone for around 9 hours a day, and we both work too far away to come home at lunch. She is extremely high energy, and while she is gradually calming down as she ages, I would still feel awful leaving her alone for so long every day, even with a dog walker.  We recently started discussing getting a second dog, so they could keep each other company while we work, but I have several concerns. While our pup gets along great with others, I'm concerned she may have issues adjusting to another dog in our small apartment. She also has some minor behavioral issues (mostly barking) I'm afraid she'll pass on to a second dog. We would also look to adopt an older dog, as we don't have the time to raise another puppy and I strongly believe in adoption, but it is extremely competitive in our area.

I have another dog he‚Äôs a yorkie and I‚Äôve had him since he was 3wks. So when we found Balto we think he was about 3 or 4 was old, he was so tiny. We named him Balto because When he was a baby he looked exactly like Balto from the movie Balto lol. We didn‚Äôt know what type of dog he was until we went to the vet to get him his shots they said he was a dashund mix. I have always fed him hard kibble and wet food. Wet food two times a day and dry food once. Ever since he was young he always ate and drank really fast. I think at about 1 years old whenever he drank water really fast he started to get really mucusy and started coughing up mucus. And when I used to make is food bowl and plopped the food in his bowl, he‚Äôd eat it way to fast and start regurgitating the food and mucus and eat it again. So whenever he would cough anything up I‚Äôd get a paper towel and have to stick it down his throat and take all of the food he just ate out. So I had to scrape together any money I had and invested in pet insurance. When I went to the doctor Balto got blood work done and an X-ray. The doctor found nothing. The doctor referred us to a pet gastro doctor. The blood work and X-ray cost me 700 and I had to charge it on my credit card. Once I filed a claim the insurance company didn‚Äôt want to reimburse me so now I owe 700 bucks. Anyways currently Balto still coughs up mucus and food whenever he eats. Currently what I‚Äôm doing is feeding him half a cup of kibble one kibble at a time because that is the only way he can keep the food down. As for wet food I give him maybe a teaspoon of wet food at a time. He eats about half a can of wet food a day. I have to manually feed him a tsp of food until he‚Äôs finish with half of the can. Although I do have a referral for a gastro doctor to see what‚Äôs wrong with his stomach a can‚Äôt afford it. I do although have some theories of what he might have; bloat or kennel cough both horrible diseases. And one more thing when he sneezes mucus comes out his nose.

978,"1) Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

*  I grew up around German Shorthair Pointers, 2 GSDs (my Aunties‚Äô dogs on both sides) and I‚Äôve owned a French Bulldog before. Mother has owned a Dalmatian, a German Wirehaired and some sort of gun dog mix used for hunting. (Not sure what mix, wasn‚Äôt born). 

2) Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a reputable breeder?

* Probably a breeder although I have no real ‚Äúpreference‚Äù. 

3) Describe your ideal dog.

* I don‚Äôt know if I have an ideal dog. I‚Äôm open to a lot of things. Honestly, I just want a dog that I can do things with and take places with me. Which I would assume is what pretty much everyone wants from a dog. 

4) What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I like German Shepherds (white long haired only), French (&amp; English) Bulldogs, Boston Terriers and I‚Äôm not opposed to some sort of mixed breed. I‚Äôve owned a Frenchie before and I loved him, big fan of all sorts of bulldogs. I like the idea of a GSD because I‚Äôm aware of their energy levels and the stamina just appeals to me because I‚Äôd like to be able to go on long walks without considering how tired they‚Äôre getting (in comparison to Frenchies). Boston Terrier is honestly... just because. 

5) What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Limitless to me. I could teach it more or I could teach it less depending on the need for mental stimulation. Definitely the basics such as sit, stay, leave it, line down etc. If I had a higher energy dog, which I‚Äôve been used to in the past, I like hiding things for them to find, scent training type of things. It depends. I‚Äôd work around it. 


Care Commitments
6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I don‚Äôt really have many time restrictions on this. As long or as little as needed. I usually like to get training in from a young age at short intervals throughout the day instead of long sessions. 

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

* Whatever was required. I would walk them, obviously. If I was to get a GSD I would probably take them to the field or the rivers to blow off steam / play frisbee etc etc. Also have two parks and plenty of woodland in my area. 

8) How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Open to anything. I have a dog groomer a ten minute walk away that I‚Äôd have no problem paying. 

Personal Preferences

9) What size dog are you looking for?

* Again, this isn‚Äôt an issue for me. 

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* None of this is an issue for me, with barking being the worst. Obviously, I‚Äôm fine with barking because we‚Äôre talking about dogs. But I wouldn‚Äôt like anything incessant. I don‚Äôt however mind a ‚Äúwhiny‚Äù dog. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Unimportant. 

Dog Personality and Behavior
12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No preference one way or the other. I would actually like the dog to sleep in my bed with me but this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúdeal breaker‚Äù and I wouldn‚Äôt be heartbroken if it didn‚Äôt want that. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Neither is that much of an issue for me. No preference beyond having an obedient dog. 

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

* No preference as long as it‚Äôs not aggression. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No, not really. Certainly not into adulthood. 

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* It‚Äôs probably worth mentioning that I was once considering adding some sort of Labrador to the list however, I find them too friendly. I can‚Äôt really articulate what I mean because I know Frenchies are quite friendly but it just feels different to me. Just personal preference, I guess. 

Lifestyle
17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Not long. 4 hours maximum most days (not in one block of time, just an hour here, 20 minutes there etc). 6 around once or twice a month. 

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

* Mother doesn‚Äôt have any dog breed preference. It would be very much ‚Äúmy dog‚Äù however she still wants to interact with it and would be comfortable feeding and giving the morning walk. 

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

* Thinking about getting a kitten. Could be flexible if someone told me my desired breed didn‚Äôt play well with others. 

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* No however my next door neighbours do have two small children (5 and 7) so I‚Äôd like a dog that wouldn‚Äôt have any issues with that. Low level importance though. 

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* We rent a house and we have no breed or weight restrictions. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* I live in the UK. I‚Äôm aware. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Typical UK weather. I googled the average weather for Newcastle and it told me the summer average is 14c and the winter average is 3c.

He has a garden where he stays while I'm gone so a cat could have made contact with him but I cant imagine how the wound matches a paw.

987,"Hi everyone, looking for a bit of advice here.
I have 3 dogs, my newest one Ruby, i found her abandoned in a carpark nearly dead with hardly any fur 4 months ago, picked her up got her to a vet immediately, and slowly but surely with natural and conventional medicine a lot of love and home made food she is now full of life such a happy bunny she loves life and all her fur is back ! She is my absolute baby, but the day we have been waiting for until she was strong enough for surgery has finally come, she has her radical mastectomy on tuesday, vet said he thinks the prognosis will be excellent and she should go on to live a full happy life with very little after treatment if any at all, which is great, she also has a large hernia and needs to be spayed. We have come to the conclusion its best to do the hernia about 6-8 weeks after as it means less time under which is safer for her shes nearly negative for leishmaniasis now but is still in the high risk category.
Basically im freaking out about her recovery the vet said it will be a big wound and is obviously going to be painful, she is happy to wear baby onesies as she worn these whilst her skin was healing so the vet agreed that she should wear that instead of a cone as it will be much more comfortable for her.
But has anyones dog had a big surgery like this? Im concerned how will i pick her up ? And also keeping her in a quiet place away from my other 2 i work from home so will be around 24/7 but do you think a large dog cage or like a popup play pen is a good idea to keep her in ? What about her going to the toilet ? Im absolutely panicked.
Any advice for post surgery care would be appreciated !

988,"I want to start out this post by saying that I already know I'm a piece of shit and that I'm doing everything I can to not be that anymore. 

About a year and half ago my parents pitbulls had puppies and I got one as a birthday present. I realize now that I was not at all prepared to take on the responsibilities of owning a dog; I was living in a shitty studio apartment with no yard, heavily abusing drugs, and I was weeks away from going to prison. Luckily the judge allowed me a few days before I was sent to jail to get my affairs in order and while I was serving my time I had family members watch the dog.

While I was incarcerated I had time to think about what brought me to where I was and I decided to try to get sober. The first three or four months out of jail were the hardest to manage, with temptations to go back to the life I was living before jail everywhere. When I got out, I took my dog back from the people who were watching him for me and during this period of my early sobriety I made a huge mistake and abused my dog. I barely knew how handle my own emotions at the time, and when the dog would tear shit up or potty in the house, I hit him. I took an opportunity to teach my dog and fucked it up, making him obey me out of fear instead of trust, and I have no idea how to fix our relationship. I know hitting an animal is some bitch ass shit to do but this was pretty much the first time I had had an extended period of sobriety since I started using drugs at around 11 years old, which I know isn't an excuse but hopefully it's enough to keep me alive &amp; out of trouble.

The longer I stayed sober the more patient and calm I was with my dog, and our relationship has improved dramatically. He listens to commands about going to his kennel and comes to me when I call his name outside, but when I try to teach him new commands like to sit or stay it's obvious that he is scared.

992,"Hi. Long time lurker here.

I have a border collie x Maltese-shitzu who is 5 years old and de sexed. We have had him since he was a puppy.

We socialised him from the time he was first fully immunised and initially he was great with other dogs.

He is groomed regularly and around other dogs he is fine at the groomers.

Both myself and my husband are at home most of the time and he comes everywhere with us in the car and then to then beach, the lake, the bush - everywhere. We have two children who play with him every day.

But when we are around, and especially the children he is so aggressive with other dogs, trying to break loose and attack them. It means we have to walk him weird places and at night, and despite the fact he has perfect recall even off a rabbit I find myself hauling a snapping snarling aggressive beast away from any dog - the bigger the more he wants to fight it.

So we can‚Äôt take him places where there are other dogs. As soon as we see one on the distance we go the other way.

We did puppy play dates and training and he is super well trained, not that it helps. It all goes out the window when he sees another dog

Both of us are life long dog owners. He is my 5th dog and my husband‚Äôs 8th.

He plays happily with dogs he knows - my parent‚Äôs jrt and a lab we know. 

But the minute he sees a strange dog he becomes a snarling wolf. 

What can I do to stop the lunging and growling? 

He has zero aggression to people but will bark of someone comes to the front door.

994,"I know this is hard for some to understand, especially those with a dog that almost completely ignores them, but my velcro dog is driving me nuts. 

She follows me everywhere, and if it's behind a closed door she'll be laying outside it when I return. 

She **never** takes her eyes off of me. She naps with one eye open. I could silently make the ""come here"" hand motion at any time or place and she'll be ready to respond. 

As a puppy I trained her to stay out of walking paths so she wouldn't trip people in the hallway or stairs. Now(2 years later) she seems to be constantly vigilant about where I am and takes extreme precautions to stay out of my way. She's constantly darting around, getting out ahead of me, and recalculating my likely routes. She'll turn on a dime if I do anything unexpected, and reroute accordingly. Now, I NEVER trip over her because of this which is good...so I understand if people find it hard to believe how it drives me nuts to constantly be watched and evaluated. 

She's very easy to train, but she's hyper concerned with doing the right trick. I'll ask her to sit, and she'll do it, panting with one paw raised off the floor, but if I hesitate with a treat or praise for 1 second she'll lay down, rollover, try to shake hands, run to her bed. She just goes nuts. The only way around that is with a ""stay"". Then she'll chill. A little. 

I can't say **anything** to our other dog without her listening in and taking it to heart. She's extremely sensitive to tone, and so telling the other dog ""no"" or ""leave it"" when food falls off the counter, even if she's sitting 20 feet away, will get a nervous response of panting, ears back, tail wagging, etc. 

If I look in her direction, even just watching TV where she might THINK that I'm looking at her, the tail immediately starts thumping the floor. Cute, right? Well, only the first 5000 times. 

As a puppy she slept in a crate, but now has a bed in that same location. Every night she sleeps in my daughter's room(our door is shut), so I know that's where she wants to sleep. The second I touch my doorknob she jumps off the bed and runs down the hallway to where her crate used to be and lays there panting. It's like she's nervous that I'll find her sleeping in the wrong location or something. I really wish she could just chill and continue sleeping wherever she wants. I feel like she wakes up in a panic and thinks ""I gotta get to the right spot!"". 

Anyway. I'm not really fishing for free advice or anything, mostly just venting. I love her to death, but man I wish she were a little more independent. The only thing she might love more than me is hunting mice in the garden, but she'll even drop that immediately if I call.

This sub has helped me a lot before and I thought I‚Äôd see if anyone has any insight. Thanks in advance for reading!


For some context: I have a female corgi, spayed, who is 15 months old.

Hi. I have a 14 year old mutt (we believe she'd got some type of terrier in her) who I'm really worried about. Her name is Daisy.

Around 4 or so months ago Daisy got into cannabis butter, overdosed, and had to be in a pet hospital for a while. Before then she's really had no problems I can think of. She got better after that but I thought that was good information to have.

I'm worried about her so much because lately she's be shaking a lot, especially in her sleep, she can't control her bladder, and is drinking an insane amount of water. A few weeks ago we started treating her for a UTI the vet said she had after a urine sample but it didn't go away. Every test still comes back with the infection and we've got her on some pretty hardcore meds but it doesn't seem to do anything but make her throw up.

We have another dog that is younger and they're very close friends and Daisy used to keep up with the younger dog pretty well until a few months ago. Now all she really does is drink water, pee, and sleep.

I know it's a part of life and all, but I'm still worried that she's not going to get better and she'll die. Our last pet to have died did so do to her kidneys failing and it reminded me of this a bit. How do I prepare myself for the inevitable when she does pass? She's been with us since I was nine.

1017,"My boyfriend and I recently adopted a 3 year old coonhound mix, Gunner. He was rescued as a stray dog so we don‚Äôt know much about his history prior to the shelter, but he‚Äôs incredibly well-behaved for the most part, isn‚Äôt dog reactive, has great leash manners and has a lot of energy. He likes to interact with other dogs and people and enjoys our long walks.

I‚Äôm seeking advice to minimize the time he‚Äôs in the crate. Both my boyfriend and I work full time; he walks/runs with Gunner at around 6am before he leaves for work, and I go on a 30 min walk with him before I leave at 8:30. He‚Äôs in the crate when we are at work except for his midday walk that we hired. When we get home at around 6pm, he is out of the crate and gets walk/playtime until lights out at around 9:30-10pm. On weekends he is mostly out of the crate unless we go on a dinner date or something for a few hours and we‚Äôll take him outdoors for a long time.

We would really love for him to sleep outside of his the crate because while he would go in the crate without a problem when we first took him home, he‚Äôs starting to be more hesitant about going on his own. A few times in the last week we‚Äôve had to push him in the crate for bedtime. But when we try to let him roam on his own, he jumps on counters, barks at us when we‚Äôre not playing with him/giving treats, and generally seems too distracted with everything around him to want to sleep.  We have a second bedroom filled with mostly his toys and dog bed (that he refuses to sleep on) and when we try to get him there to sleep, he simply walks back to the kitchen area and tries to jump on the counter.

Gunner is starting training this week at a dog school but I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs things you‚Äôve done in your experience to help this transition from crate to free roam and helping the dog sleep elsewhere without jumping on counters, barking when not given attention even when he‚Äôs had plenty of exercise and play time, etc. It breaks my heart to force him somewhere he doesn‚Äôt want to go but we also don‚Äôt know how we can help this transition.

Basically, he doesn‚Äôt seem happy.

Also, if we encroach on his ‚Äòpersonal space‚Äô, he often growls - more warning than attack - and removes himself from the situation.

1019,"I have two dogs, but my main concern is our Brittany Spaniel. Our other dog is at a healthy weight.

Male Brittany Spaniel, fixed, 1 year old, overweight (currently 47 pounds, vet tech said he should be 40 pounds), no other health problems

Previous vet visit he was at a healthy weight, but today we went to the vet to get his nails trimmed and the vet tech said that he is overweight.

I'm looking for guidance on how to feed both of my dogs so that the younger one loses weight. I suspect that the reason that our younger dog is overweight might possibly be due to him eating his own food plus whatever is leftover from our other dog. I also give them treats and a greenie or bully stick regularly.

Currently I feed them twice a day. They also get treats and a greenie. I plan on buying lower calorie treats and maybe a greenie every other day in addition to changing how I feed them. I am also going to decrease the amount of dog food they eat. I measure out their food, to what is on the dog food bag, but I am going to go a bracket or two lower. 

What is the best way to do this? I was thinking about feeding them both in separate rooms twice a day and maybe mixing a small amount of boiled chicken or one to two tablespoons of non fat cottage cheese into their food to make sure that they eat at the designated time. 

If they decide not to eat at the time (most likely I'll have a problem with our older dog), should I take their bowls away for an hour and try again or would that be too long or too short? I am home most of the time so I'm not too worried about how long it takes.

I'm thinking about taking him back to the vet to be weighed in a month to make sure that he is losing weight.

1020," 

This is all 1000% true. I know if I were on the other side, I wouldn't believe a word I say. I would like everyone to know I am completely sober and of sound body and mind. The experience I had last night is seared into my brain and I can't think of anything else. I am completely disturbed and horrified. But, I need help because this is unprecedented and there is nothing I can find through the countless Google searches I've done in the past few hours.

Here it goes.

I have a friend named Roberto. I have known him since we were in the 6th grade. We are truly each others' best friends. We do everything together. We live down the street from each other and we essentially spend any time not at work or school with each other.

Here's some random background that will come into play later: Roberto is gay. Roberto is very, very sexually active, and he also has a past trauma of rape that he never, ever brings up. The only reason I know about the rape is because his mother told me. I don't even know if he knows I know about it. I don't bring it up because I imagine he should be the first to mention it.

Roberto has an adorable German Shepherd puppy named Rosy. She's about 5 months old, but she's huge. We adore her. Her and I are best pals. Roberto bought her from a friend when she was about 2.5 months old. She's a puppy, so she's very energetic and playful. Lately, she has been seeming very very clingy to me whenever I'm around. I didn't question this. I just thought she was getting more attached to me.

Last night, Roberto and I were in his backyard watching a movie together and smoking weed (we live in a legal state). When it started getting cold, we went back into his room to finish the movie and eventually go to sleep. As soon as Roberto got into bed, Rosy jumped on top of him, and he covered the both of them with the blanket.

I was laying next to him on top of the blanket. I heard moaning. I heard Roberto saying ""this feels so good"" at least 2 or 3 times. I asked him what he was doing to Rosy, and he said ""she's letting me pet her"". I asked twice and he answered the same both times.

The moaning and weird movement started getting super weird, so I just flat out said ""dude, it sounds like you're fucking your dog"". Immediately Roberto yelled ""what the fuck?!"" and kicked Rosy off the bed. At this point, I was so disturbed that I had completely sobered up to the point of internally freaking out.

As soon as Rosy got on the floor of his room, she had extremely watery diarrhea. She had been sick that day because of ""eating different dog food"" according to Roberto. She had diarrhea at least 2 times before that just while I was visiting him. The room was pitch black, but I told Roberto ""Rosy is shitting"" and he got up to investigate, and told me he didn't see anything. He left the room though, and once he was gone, I turned the light on, and sure enough, there was poop on the ground. He lied to me. He came back into the room with paper towels and cleaning spray. I told him ""Rosy DID shit"" and he acted like I was dumb saying ""yeah?? I know???"".

Rosy immediately cowered away from Roberto when he came back into the room and came to my side. When Roberto tried getting her to eat or drink water, she refused to leave my side.

At this point, Roberto and I were really awkward with each other. I think he knew I knew what happened. He was taking it very personally that Rosy wouldn't go to him when he commanded even though she's already properly trained to do so.

For the rest of the night, Roberto and I didn't speak to each other. We slept, but I was wide awake all night, searching on my phone what to do in this situation. I couldn't find anything.

I just got home from his house. I left as soon as I could without raising suspicion. I called our mutual best friend, Rachel. I told her everything, and even she is completely astounded and has no idea what to do.

Here are some other random details that I have been noticing and freaking out over:

* There are brown spots all over Roberto's bed. I thought it might have been mud that Rosy tracked in from outside. Now, I'm not so sure.
* Roberto has a random stash of condoms in his dresser. He showed me randomly, but I found it strange, because in the past, Roberto has always been candid about his sex life with me, and he always told me he never brings condoms to hookups because he's a ""bottom"" and the guy fucking him should bring the condom. But Roberto never ""tops"" so why does he need condoms? I'm freaking out.
* Roberto had ANOTHER German Shepherd puppy earlier this year. His name was Robin. Robin was an energetic puppy. Not even a year old. But he randomly got very, very sick and passed away suddenly a few months ago. I remember being devastated and upset because it was just so random. There were no signs of sickness beforehand or anything. He just randomly became lethargic and passed away. I am now very suspicious about his death.
* Last night, I heard sounds of crinkling plastic (like... a condom wrapper) and I asked ""what's that noise"" to which he responded ""nothing"". This happened right before all the suspicious movement under the blankets.
* The way Roberto gushes about Rosy and even Robin was always very sexual. Roberto is just a slut and super sexual, and we both know that and I love it about him sometimes too, but now I'm rethinking everything and this grosses me out completely.
* After I told him it sounded like he was fucking his dog in the dark, Roberto became very serious for the rest of the night and wouldn't be affectionate or caring towards Rosy if she got close to him like he normally would have.
* Roberto always talks about the types of dogs he wants to get in the future, and always says he wants ""big, beautiful dogs"". He says he eventually wants 2 dalmatians, a giant poodle, and a border collie when he's older. I'm suddenly super grossed out remembering this.

Roberto is my BEST friend, and I am so fucking disgusted right now. I know he has some unacknowledged trauma in his past that may explain this strange behavior, but I'm afraid to bring it up to him since he doesn't know I'm aware of this. And I know that if I confront him, he will say ""you were SO stoned last night, you don't know what you're talking about"".

Rosy is the sweetest dog in the whole fucking world and I have a responsibility to protect her and make sure she isn't being abused, but I couldn't find any animal sexual abuse information online. Who do I call? A vet? The cops? Animal control?

Please help.

***TLDR: I have tons of reasons to suspect my childhood friend is sexually abusing his puppy, but I'm too mortified and confused to confront him on this. I have searched online, but couldn't find any resources for sexual abuse with animals. I don't know what to do next.***

1021,"My dog got meningitis about a week ago. It was diagnosed about 5 days ago. The only symptom was extremely weird focal seizures, but CSF + MRI confirmed meningitis. He's on prednisone and phenobarbital for it. Watching him recover has been incredibly stressful. I feel guilty for even feeling stressed out; my focus should be on him...

The good news is that I think he's doing better. His treatment stopped the seizures and he is gradually getting used to the phenobarbital (he's been on it for about 5 days), at least insofar as the ataxia is getting better. The thing that stresses me out is that he's just being *weird*. He'll just be walking around and he'll stop dead in his tracks and just stand there for awhile. He's aware (he'll respond to his name, noises, moving things, etc.), but it's like he just decided to stop for a little bit and stand still. I don't think this is a focal seizure (his focal seizures were more dramatic than that), but I don't really know what it is.

He's has bouts of restlessness, and I don't know how to satisfy him. He isn't super interested in playing with his toys right now, so I try to comfort him, but at a certain point it's just him wandering around aimlessly. He normally isn't like this at all - he's normally attached to me and will lay down wherever I'm at just to be near me. The restlessness is super worrying, because I don't know what to do and I don't know if it's a sign that the treatment isn't working.

I haven't gotten good sleep in days and I think this is contributing to my extreme stress levels. The steroids have him drinking water *constantly* (I was shocked at how bad the thirst is -- he downs 10 or more bowls of water per day) and as a result, I have to get up 3-4 times during the night to let him out. If I don't give him water he prowls around looking for it (nor do I feel super comfortable withholding water from a sick dog). His energy levels also went up one day, and are a bit down today, so I have no idea how to interpret that.

I just watch him all the time wondering if he's okay and what the latest quirk means. Work is also incredibly stressful right now, and the combination of the two almost feels like too much. We are having weekly visits with the neurologist, so he's well-taken care of medically, but the days in between visits are absolute hell for me. He's my best friend, and I can't help but stress about every little detail of his condition. Again, I feel guilty for even feeling this way, but I'm at the end of my rope with stress had to get it off of my chest somewhere.

1022,"Sorry if this is long, but yeah, like the title says we have bears in the neighbourhood. The area I live in has bears by the barrel full and no one wants them to be shot by conservation so we all just kind of keep garbage and fallen fruit to a minimum and let them do their thing. We leave them alone, they leave us alone. They're mostly only active at night and early in the morning anyway, so by this point everyone is used to hearing them lumbering around in the darkness... except my one year old lab. 

She sleeps in my room with me and every time she hears a bear she hops out of bed and paces around with her skittery little claws. It keeps me up, which sucks, but I feel worse that she is so on guard that she can't even lay down. The only way I have found to relax her when this happens is to sit up and pet her all night, because she will literally pace until the sun comes up. I have also tried getting up with her and standing out side while she ""investigates"" but she literally just goes to the last place she saw a bear and sits and waits and when you bring her in she goes right back to pacing. 

I have had people tell me to just throw her outside and leave her, that that's what she wants, but that is not an option because we also have cougars in the area that are so desensitized to people that we have actually had them coming up and looking in people's windows before. They have literally taken down grazing deer in people's front yards so no one really keeps their dogs outside for more than a few minutes without watching them anymore. Also she is like my baby, so no way am I going to be able to sleep knowing she's outside where anyone or anything can come get her. 

I would like to somehow teach her the bear's specific sounds (because they definitely sound different from say, a human trying to break in) so that she knows when she is inside she can relax if she hears them. Is it even possible to teach a dog to alert you to certain sounds only at certain times? I also don't want to accidentally teach her that bears aren't dangerous because the last thing I want is her running up to some babies to play when a mama is near by. 

Needless to say the bears and the cougars and the dog are all here to stay. If anyone who has had a similar experience has any advice to offer I would really, REALLY appreciate it. We all need to get some sleep around here.",[Help] Is there a way to calm my dog when there is a bear outside?,dogs
1023,"My schnauzer was just diagnosed with CHF a month or two ago. She's only 10, but the meds (Lasix and Vetmedin) have been working pretty well so far. Prior, she's had a murmur for a couple years. 4/6. It hadn't gotten worse, the vet had been monitoring her. Now she's a 5/6. She's had no real significant coughing or lethargic episodes since her first and second times in syncope, second time we took get to MedVet emergency. She's a little dumpy some days now, looking very tired, but for the most part she still enjoys doing all her usual things.

She's been a part of my heart since I got her as a four month old puppy and of course I'd like for her to live as long as possible as long as she's not in pain.  

My questions are: is CHF in the final days (or anytime really) painful? Would it be inhumane of me to let her pass naturally at home with us? 

I remember very clearly when my mom, sister and I had to put down my schnauzer a decade ago at the vets office and I didn't like watching her go (no one does but she watched me as she struggled to cling to life as her eyes rolled back in her head...that's gut wrenching to see your pet be so scared and confused as to what is happening and eventually just go because the chemicals took over). She had cushings disease and was no longer eating and was vomiting and having severe diarrhea. I was away at college and came home to see her off. I never want to have this happen again. Not for my girl, not for me. 

I would potentially consider having her put down at home in her favorite spot next to me, but I'd still prefer her go naturally as long as she's not in pain. Can anyone provide clarity on this? Also if you have experience with a dog having CHF, when did you find it necessary to put him or her down?

I‚Äôm super tired of hearing the word ‚Äúadopt‚Äù becoming interchangeable with the word ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù.

I used to believe that leases / restraints were the primary issue - but this behavior is the same at no-leash parks too.

I am at wits end, as we have tried most soothing options (recommended by local pet store) and we are considering behavioral therapy; unfortunately, the latter is just too expensive currently as I just moved my family cross-country - and this move and life is our first together as a young family.

My dog is 17 years old, I'm currently 18, he basically been there my whole life, he is my best buddy and I love him to death. Half hour ago I woke up to my sound of my dog crying, I saw him jumping on the front door, I took him back to his spot, but when I picked him up I felt his underside was wet, I guess he pissed somewhere and sort of lied on it... so I took him out to the garden but he was really sloppy and sort of walked in circles.

So I got him back in, and tried to give him a treat, but he didn't take or even cared about it (even because I put it up to his mouth and nose), which is concerning because he always up for a treat.

1048,"A few days ago I put down my 10.5 year old Pyrenees. On Friday I woke up to him panting in my face and walking with a limp with his right hind leg. As the morning progressed the limp only seemed to get worse to the point where he began to drag it. When he tried to come inside from using the restroom his leg gave out entirely, plotting him halfway in and halfway out. We were able to bring him inside where he sat down and just began panting. He refused to lay down and he couldn't stand back up without any help. He did however want to go back out, so we put him outside and he laid in the grass. 

At this point I had to leave for work and my mother kept me updated as the day went on. He came in before a rain and once inside went back to the living room. However he eventually scooted and circled to a spot in the kitchen and just fell over and went right to sleep. Through the rest of the evening he barley moved. If anyone tried to help him up he would whine and once even growled. When I returned late that night he was laying perfectly still outside his breathing. He didn't react to any of my touches, but just followed me with his eyes. We attempted to contact a house call vet the entire day but the only one that would come and see us wasn't available until Wednesday morning. He only said to give him some pain medicine which seemed to not work what so ever. 

The next morning my brother arrived and we tried to lift him into the car. He sat up but once again wouldn't use his hind legs. My brother eventually picked him up and set him in the car and we drove to an emergency vet after a few more phone calls that couldn't give us results. On the way he did stand up on all fours, and did again when we arrived. They took him in the back and we didn't see him for a hour or so. They called us into a private room and he was clearly panicking and in pain. He couldn't calm down at all.  The vet described the symptoms as neurological degradation, and that he was losing the ability to function on that leg and his left leg couldn't keep holding up the slack. She began to talk about different options. Surgery, medicines, therapy, things to expect down the line. At this point my mom brought up quality of life and the vet took a serious turn and let us know that while there have been cases of dogs living a long time after, given how fast this came on it wouldn't be surprising if we were back in her office a few weeks later talking about where to go from there. 

So after 30 or so minutes of trying to consider this and the other health issues he seemed to have while crying we came to the conclusion that we should not have him suffer for another couple weeks for our sake and put him down. I can't escape the feeling though that after a couple days he would have been okay. But considering the vets words and how he was in so much pain that he wouldn't lay down until he was too exhausted and stressed that he just collapsed even if he did there was clearly a lot of damage that couldn't just be recovered from. We went in thinking it was arthritis due to the extreme cold weather change. We weren't prepared for this and I feel everything went too fast. We just took the vet at her word. I didn't give him a chance to possibly get better. It's killing me inside and the only positive is to know that he can't at least be suffering now.

1053,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

We were wondering if anyone has had similar issues and could help out. We've got a lovely 13 year old Staffy x Rotty who appears very young and is generally healthy (hasn't needed a vet visit in the 3 years since we got him from the rescue until now), but who recently has started behaving erratically.

&amp;#x200B;

On either the Sunday or Monday for the past three weeks (so once a week), he becomes:

&amp;#x200B;

* Lethargic
* Slow
* Unresponsive
* Uninterested in food (extremely unusual for this guy)
* Gets white gums
* Has problems walking (especially down stairs); seems to be a back legs issue
* Does a small poo inside (highly unusual, he's fully house trained)

&amp;#x200B;

We brought him to the vet and did full blood works, but everything appeared fine (incl. blood pressure, temperature, weight, etc.). Slight anemia, slight liver issues, but nothing significant (not on pathological levels). He also doesn't vomit, or have blood in his excrement, etc., and he normally doesn't have problems walking except for slight arthritis when it's cold. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened in the previous two instances (instance #three is happening right now ;() is that after him resting for a few hours in above \^ described state, we take him for an extremely slow 15 minute walk, and after that, he slowly perks back up, until the next day he is his old self again. This makes us think it's a blood circulation issue, that as soon as we get his heart rate up somehow, he gets back to normal? Maybe?

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, the vet doesn't know what is going on, and nor do we, really! Does anyone have any similar experiences or perhaps ideas of what could be going on? We will be taking him back to the vet for additional tests (next step is an ultrasound), but we're just wondering if anyone had a similar experience, and whether this is just old age after all (despite his normal youthful behaviour).

My dad could not walk him because of hes health issues, my mother and i had a really troubling experience and since then we walk our friend in fear of it happening again. Sam got attacked by a pit bull when he was 3 years old since then most of the walking was handled by my dad.

I can still remember him lying on the ground with hes belly bleeding and open eyes full of fear and hope that i can help him haunts me till this day.....

So now my moms and my problem is how can we overcome this fear, i dont know what to do i always look if i can spot the owner of the dog who attacked my Sam so i can go on a walk after him but unfortunately we do not know when hes walking times are and now he even has a new pit bull and walks with 2 dogs he can not control.

1056,"Hi everyone, 

This past Saturday, my pug dog passed away. I loved him and I still love him but I feel like I didn't give him the attention that he deserved. For example, I would pet him ever single night and let him outside when he wanted. I know he lived a good life even though he was only 8 years old when he passed, but I feel like I didn't let him on my lap enough or play with him enough or take him on the extra walk or so. On Friday, I sort of disregarded him and I didn't even really think about him tbh, then I went out with my friends, and when I got home didn't really pay much mind as well. The same thing happened with my fish a few years back. I sort of forgot about him then the next day he wasn't with us. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, anyway I kind of feel heartless because I had him since I was 9, and I was the one always asking for a dog, especially a pug. The day he passed away I was crying and upset in my room pretty much the entire day, but Sunday my parents forced me to go shopping with them and through the entire day, I didn't really feel any emotion. Like, I was upset but not cry worthy upset. Also, today when I went to school, I didn't tell anyone, and he was in my thoughts since Saturday but I was laughing and trying to have a good time. I don't want it to be because I don't care because I do. I know every reacts different to losses, but I feel like something is wrong with me, that I kind of just forgot about him once I lost him. I felt like being sad is an act I am trying to put on. I know that I miss him deep down inside but it didn't hit me like up front. Also, it was so sudden because we weren't expecting anything since he was so young. Typically I am not an emotional person, but I though that I would be super upset when he isn't around anymore.

1058,"[possibly obligatory pet tax](https://imgur.com/a/uRBuyYK) 

TL;DR - Should I go to the police to report the dog attack, what kind of trouble can the owners of the dog get into? Should I first discuss with them that they should raise their fence or put the dogs into chains and only take action when they fail to act on my demands?

So, the previous Sunday (not the one yesterday) I was walking my dog when I walked past a house with 4 quite aggressive dogs. Unfortunately one of them was a pitbull who jumped the fence and proceeded to briefly attack me, then my dog, badly injuring his paw.

It required a vet visit which ended up costing around ¬£1K.

Now, thankfully, insurance covered it. But I am still not sure if I should request it back from the owners or not, my sister thinks that we get a specific ""quota"" every fiscal year in terms of how much money the insurance will cover, is this true?

Other thing is, the police, the vet told me to report them as well as most people did. The thing is however a bit complicated, they visited us on the next day to check up and were quite nice and apologetic (during the attack the entire street eventually came out in support due to my dog howling so badly, still hard to sleep since it replays in my head like a demo of PTSD). That doesn't necessarily stop me from reporting them, two things really do. First of all they know everyone around us, they know where we live, I am scared they will do something radical if they get fined or worse. The second thing being that they said about mine and the specific dog that attacked us having a tussle about 5 years ago where my dog injured his, and he isn't normally this aggressive. I can't remember this encounter (albeit my sister apparently can) and I am not so sure about the claim of their dog not being normally this aggressive.

The second dog was in the process of jumping the fence (keep in mind at this point I was holding both of them down and had my hand in between them as I thought the pitbull had my dog by the throat) I am pretty sure if all 4 of them jumped I wouldn't be writing this post today, or if I did it certainly wouldn't be with my dog. 

So should I report them anyway? What can happen if I do, keeping in mind I could be very seriously injured (he missed my main artery by about 2 cm on my hand)

She‚Äôs 3 years old and about 19 inches shoulder height, 19 inches around at her chest, and weighs about 35 pounds.  She does not have a ridged back, her tongue is pink, and her tail curls, but not tightly.

She rarely barks, is super friendly towards people (including small kids; she is not into other dogs though), and seems to have two modes:  run/walking and lazing/sleeping.  She isn‚Äôt into treats, food, or toys.  She‚Äôs very chill: the kids can be tantruming and she just continues to laze without reacting.  She doesn‚Äôt fetch or play, but she‚Äôll walk/run a ton (we average 5 miles a day) and she has a very high prey drive for small animals that move quickly (especially rabbits).  She herds me and the kids on walks and also likes to sniff everything in new places.  She‚Äôs also got a few weird traits: she sleeps curled up like a cat, she ‚Äùmakes bread‚Äú and circles before she sits or sleeps anywhere, and she tries to bury her waste (as well as any treats she is given). She also grooms like a cat - licks everywhere including licking her paws to groom her face.

The rescue we got her from said she‚Äôs a basenji-cattle dog mix, but I don‚Äôt see cattle dog at all and the basenji seems unlikely just given how rare they are. (Unless they‚Äôre more common in Asia?)

I work eight hour days with a one hour commute, so I'm gone ten hours daily. My dog who passed away in June had access to a crate but spent the workday mostly on the couch and slept with me in my bed. 

I adopted my new girl in July and she very quickly took to her crate. She has a hard time settling outside of it and never whines or barks when she runs in for her kibble or kong. I let her out and feed her before work, and then have a dog walker take her out midday for a 20 minute walk. I've contemplated doggie daycare but my sister works at one and told me horror stories about how dogs are treated so I'm apprehensive.

I get home between 5:15 and 6:00 and stay up until anywhere from 10:30 to 12 at night. She spends the entire evening with me, usually about two hours of them on a walk and/or at the dog park. We play at home, do trick training, cuddle on the couch, and she eats out of puzzle toys. On weekends I spend 90% of my waking time with her either in the apartment or out for hikes, walks, dog park visits etc. She's very well socialized and seems very happy.

7. 	*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of  exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that  include using a dog park?*

A few hours, I envision walks/jogs, dog parks, the occasional hike

8.	*How much  regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair,  cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be  willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?*

I'd prefer a dog with fewer grooming requirements

**Personal Preferences**

9.	*What size dog are you looking for?*

medium to medium small, I live in an apartment and will do so for the next while. Currently I have \~460 ft2 and no yard, this will likely remain the case for the next 5 years

10.	*How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?*

I'd prefer less shedding, but its a dog I get that it's going to shed. As its an apartment, barking at a minimum would be best

11.	*How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?*

Not super, hiking off leash would be nice but is in no way a necessity

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	*Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?*

I like a snuggly dog, but it should be independent enough to handle days where I'm in the lab for \~5 hours at a time. Though I'm close enough to be able to stop home every few hours even on long days.

13.	*Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?*

I don't really know

14. 	*How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the  door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet  strangers or visitors?*

I'd like a friendly dog, not a guard dog

15.	*Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?*

Same as above, friendly is better for me

16.	*Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?*

Don't think so

**Lifestyle**

17.	*How often and how long will the dog be left alone?*

Every weekday, for 3-5 hours at a time

18.	*What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?*

I live by myself

19.	*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?*

Nope, just the one dog is all I'm looking for. However, I'm in my early 20s and lots of things could change within the dog's lifespan

20.	*Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?*

Nope

21.	*Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?*

I live in a 1br apartment, landlord says no bulls, pitbulls or pitbull mixes, or yippie small dogs (his words, so I'm not totally sure but I assume no chihuahuas or anything like that..). Otherwise there are no size restricitons or anything like that.

I'll be here for the next 5 or so years, after that I don't know where I'll end up. I think 50lb is a pretty common size restriction though.

22.	*What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?*

Providence RI, USA  I'm not aware of any

23.	*What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?*

Summers get warm, winters are cold. S:60-80F W:20-40F

**Additional Information and Questions**

1070,"I have a 2 year old husky who has a chewing problem as well as potty issues. I‚Äôm not sure what to do and my boyfriend is debating on getting rid of her. When we first adopted her, she had no problem. But after 2 months, she would frequently poop or pee in our living. The same spot every time. We would bring her outside several times a day to make sure she does it but she still continuously did it. She also started chewing on baseboards and tore up clothes from the laundry room.

My boyfriend put her in a $2,000 boarding school for a month. After she came back, she still had issues with chewing. The trainer insisted that she‚Äôs a puppy and to just provide a lot more chew toys even though we‚Äôve already bought a lot. She still went back to peeing and pooping in the living room. I know she knows to go in the backyard because if we‚Äôre downstairs with her then she‚Äôll bring us to the door. But if we‚Äôre upstairs for even half an hour then she‚Äôll just do it in the living room. I know we have to reinforce what she was taught in training school but we spend time aside to go over what she was taught daily. Yet she still only listens half the time. The trainer only recommends we crate train her.

Today was the worst because she chewed up our couch in the living room. My boyfriends mom says I‚Äôm not tough on her and expects me to hit her and lock her up for several hours as punishment. I really don‚Äôt want to get rid of her because the previous owner was hard on her and I don‚Äôt want her going through several houses.

1072,"My brothers dog had to be put down yesterday because of aggressive stomach cancer that rendered him unable to keep his food down and eventually unable to move. He was a walking skeleton and when he stopped eating all together and couldn't really move we decided it was time. Let's call this a three-faceted rant. One the obvious ranting about my anger and sadness at his death. He was only 5 years old and so full of life and energy and positivity. To see him go from a happy pup to cancer ridden in the matter of "" one month"" is something we were all wholly unprepared for. 

I put ""one month"" in quotes because he actually displayed some symptoms like 8 months ago that the vet just dismissed which takes me to part two of my rant. So 8 months ago he stopped eating and he was very lethargic which as I mentioned is completely uncharacteristic of him. He stayed like that for 6 days (we waited that long because the other dog with him was in heat and we initially attributed it to that but we realized the episode lasted longer than usual). So I take him to the shitty vet in my shitty country with no good vets (coming to that later) I tell him all his symptoms, which I later learned were textbook of the stomach cancer that eventually killed him. He pokes and prods at him for what couldn't be more than 30 seconds and sends him home telling me he's A-okay. Doesn't ask questions, doesn't order any blood work, x-rays, nothing. So okay great the dog is okay. He goes back to eating and moving and he's back to his old self. About a month ago he started vomiting anything he ate. So my brother took him to another vet who x-rayed him and said there seems to be an obstruction, something he swallowed that's preventing the food from staying down and that he needs to operate. Once he does, he says that his stomach lining is inflamed and that it's stomach cancer. There's nothing he can do because it's not an isolated lump or something that can be removed its his whole stomach. So we just essentially waited for him to get to a point where he needed to be put down and it was the most heart-breaking gut-wrenching, anxiety-ridden time of my life. So had the first vet asked for just blood work or something we could have caught it and operated or treated it before it spread. But alas, we have the equivalent of 30 shitty GPs with no vet actually specializing in anything or qualified for such a case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Having said all that, when I've turned to Reddit out of pure desperation in the past for help I've always been down voted to hell and I get 30 replies saying take your dog to the vet. I come to Reddit not because I'm lazy, not because I don't want to pay, not because I don't love my dog enough. I come to Reddit BECAUSE I love my dog and my family dogs so much and because I won't settle for sub-par vets that studied the anatomy of a chicken in the suburbs and then opened a clinic and started ""treating"" dogs and cats. For fucks sake when my own dog had a lump they misdiagnosed him because I later learned they sent the biopsy to A HUMAN PATHOLOGIST. When i told them that was unacceptable and found an online vet pathologist (basically begged for the slides back) the results came back benign after they had initially told me it was malignant. So I don't know how I can get help on Reddit when my dog has a problem in the future and how to explain that we just do not have adequate veterinary care here and now more than ever I will not be trusting the vets. I'm so sad and angry.

TL;DR: My brothers dog was put down yesterday after an ugly battle with stomach cancer. He showed symptoms early on that the vet dismissed. Also since we have shitty vets I sometimes turn to Reddit for advice and basically get yelled at to take my dog to the vet over and over again.

1073,"Posting for my father, who is at his wits end.

My parents have a lab mix, Cocoa, who is extremely destructive. 

A bit of a backstory: My parents got another dog after I left for college and our old dog passed away. Empty nester syndrome I suppose. She‚Äôs a great gal, smart and friendly. Lovely companion for my parents. A year or so later, my uncle brought home a new puppy, but since his house didn‚Äôt have a fence yet, he asked to keep his pup at my parents‚Äô home until that was sorted. 

6 years later, and Cocoa is still with them. Unfortunately, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be trainable. He always jumps on guests (which, at 70lbs, easily tops people over!), won‚Äôt stay out of the no-dog zones of the house, and chews up anything (trees, sprinklers and hoses, furniture). He is the worst digger I have ever seen. He digs MASSIVE holes in the yard; the worst one is on the side of the house and he has reached the bottom of the foundation. They‚Äôve tried refilling, filling with bricks, putting cayenne pepper, putting poop, nothing works.

My parents have cared for him the same as their other dog, but they are getting too old and tired to be dealing with his shenanigans. He hasn‚Äôt mellowed out of his puppy antics like their other dog. I also think his puppy-like energy irritates their other dog, who is getting a bit grey now. My uncle won‚Äôt take him back, friends and colleagues won‚Äôt take him. I know pets are lifetime commitments, but they didn‚Äôt even want him to begin with, since it was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. I don‚Äôt live in the same country so I can‚Äôt take him. I think he just needs extra stimulation which my parents, at their age, can‚Äôt or aren‚Äôt willing to accommodate.

I have to say I'm quite surprised. The entire staff seems to really care about the pets. The vets are also pretty great and knowledgeable. I haven't seen any cutting corners when it comes to pet care like I expected. 

Problems come up mostly from just the overwhelming volume of clients seen and the usual corporate bs (which has its pros too).

Interestingly enough, the clientele is noticeably different than the kind I'm used to dealing with from my previous private clinic. Unfortunately people are a lot less reasonable and we get a lot of ""problem clients"". We also get those that refuse to provide the recommended basic care for their pets which is frustrating.

1084,"I wanted to share our story about our beautiful baby Lola, who passed away last night. 

My then girlfriend and I drove an hour to ‚Äúlook‚Äù at puppies and came back with a wrinkly little pooch that night. A year later, her step-brother pup Loki joined us and the four of us spent the next amazing seven years together. My girlfriend and I got married in that time and bought our first house. One thing that we never tired of was the snoring and drool that made this house a home. 

In February of 2016 we lost Loki suddenly to cancer. He went peacefully on his bed surrounded by those that loved him. Lola seemed to take it the worst, as she would sniff around on his bed and look at us knowing that something was missing. Our financial and work situation at the time prevented us from providing another companion for Lola so it‚Äôs just been the three of us for a year and a half now. 

In November of last year, Lola was diagnosed with glaucoma in both eyes and ended up losing one. She took it like a boss and when the e-collar came off, it was like nothing had changed. A few months ago, Lola started having seizures which were eventually diagnosed as a brain tumor. In the last week, her breathing and heart rate has gotten worse and we finally made the decision to help her pass last night. 

Her Best Day Ever was filled with chicken nuggets, cheesecake, and slices of cheese (her favorite) not to mention love and hugs and tears. She finally passed in our arms, giving kisses until the meds finally gave her her first restful sleep in weeks. 

The house is so quiet now. My wife and I haven‚Äôt known a home without dogs and the lack of click-clacks of nails on the hardwood and snoring on the couch are eerie. We‚Äôre having trouble trying to adjust to it.

1086,"Hello redditors, as the title suggests, I'm looking for a companion and I was hoping that some of you might be able to persuade or dissuade me entirely based on the following responses. Thanks in advance for taking time out of your day to read, reply, and respond!

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

\- I'm looking at the infamous Shiba Inu (for its independent nature), smaller terriers (popularity in apartments), and some spaniel breeds (such as King Charles, ESS, etc; once again due to apartment popularity). Independence and comfortability with a less attentive lifestyle and small living accommodations is highly important. I do have access to parks at all times and do plan on walks frequently (for my sake and the dog's). 

\*\*What role is your dog expected to fill and how do you envision your dog fulfilling that role?\*\*   

 \-My dog would be expected to be a roommate that respects hierarchy, if that makes sense. I need the animal to be independent and comfortable with my schedule allotting for frequent exercise, but no nonsense and doting. 

\*\*What experience do you have owning dogs? How about training dogs?

 I had a black lab growing up and I trained several beagles for trials.

\*\* Have you been the primary caregiver of a dog before? If yes, what breed(s)? What is your experience with puppy or senior dog care?  

\-I have indeed- a black lab and several beagles. My father owns a vet clinic and provides easy access to puppy and senior dog care for me.

\*\*Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?\*\* If so, what breed/type, age, and sex are they?   

\-I do not have other pets and would only like a single dog, which means it must be comfortable with a less social home environment.

\*\*Do you have children or are you planning on having children? Do you often have children as visitors, such as nieces, nephews, cousins, or friends' children?\*\*   

\- No children or children visitors, although my mates may very well be children.

\*\*Do you rent or will you be renting in the future? If so, what breed or weight restrictions are on your lease?\*\* What type of building do you rent (condo, apartment, high-rise apartment, townhome, single-family home, etc)?  

\- I will only be renting for the time being, smaller dogs are encourages-no inherently aggressive or less ""reputed"" breeds such as pit bulls. Although, I do know from experience that some pits are wonderful. My accommodations in the foreseeable future will be college/employer provided (I do research) and the apartment will be rather small, but does have a living area and plenty of space across campus to walk.

\*\*Who lives in your household and who will be responsible for taking care of the dog?\*\* How do the other members of the household feel about having a new dog?  

\-A grad student is the only other house member. He is perfectly okay with me getting a dog, but I will likely do most of the care. I imagine that he will eventually want to play with the dog or walk though.

 \*\*How often do you have visitors to your home?\*\*  

\-Hmm tough one...almost never.

\*\*Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a knowledgeable and reputable breeder?  \*\*Do you want a puppy, a young adult (1-3 years), an adult, or a senior? Why?\*\*   

\- I undoubtedly want a puppy through a breeder. A puppy so that I can be responsible for training and social conditioning and a breeder to control some more unpredictable variables such as temperament as tightly as possible.

\*\*What size dog are you looking for?\*\* \[Here is a size chart for your convenience.\](r/http://i.imgur.com/vnz3usJ.jpg)  

\-I would like a smaller dog. Preferably one under 30 pounds. 

\*\*How much barking is too much barking?\*\*   

\-Any barking at all is a nuisance, but I don't mind excited noises.

\*\*How much regular brushing are you willing to do?\*\*  

\- I can brush every now and then. I don't mind cleaning a dog if necessary, but would prefer something more fastidious and careful with its own coat.

 \*\*How much shedding do you think you can handle?\*\* Some breeds of dogs shed more than others.  Some breeds don't shed, but require trimming or other coat maintenance instead. 

 \-I can tolerate some shedding (such as seasonal shedding), but if it is constant, no thank you. Coat maintenance on a bi-weekly schedule such as brushing or seasonal shedding only. 

 \*\*Are you open to trimming your dog's hair, cleaning ears, clipping nails, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?\*\*  

 \-I would just go to my father's clinic for these things, but I am trained as a technician to perform these actions if I'm away for too long. 

\*\*How do you feel about slobber? What about farts?\*\*  

 \-No. Just no thank you. Dignity please. 

\*\*How eager-to-please or independent do you want your dog to be?\*\*  

 \-It should respect me, but should be fairly independent. 

\*\*What sorts of training do you want your adult dog to have?\*\*   

\- As in known skills? The dog should be able to sit, stay, recall, and will be leash trained while knowing that barking is not tolerated. 

\*\*Is there any behavior you can‚Äôt accommodate?\*\*   

\-Barking. The other behaviours that I can't tolerate can pretty easily be conditioned. I will use a shock collar though if that is the only option. I do live in an apartment complex and this behaviour will get the dog sent home. 

\*\*How important is being able to let your dog roam off-leash in an unfenced area?\*\*   

\-Unimportant. I would prefer to keep a dog on a leash in an open area just to avoid any potential skirmishes or contact with unvaccinated animals. 

 \*\*How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What kinds of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly?\*\*   

\-At least a 30min-hour long walk a day, more sporadic walks as a puppy.

\*\*How long do you have to devote to mental stimulation each day?\*\*   

\- Tough one..Really depends on my schedule. I can allot a walk, but the dog should be independent enough to function on its own just in case I stay late.

\*\*Where will the dog be kept when alone and where will the dog sleep?\*\*  

 \-The dog will be crate trained and will have its own space in a crate, with a bed along with some of its toys. I wouldn't want an animal in my bed under most circumstances. It will stay in the lobby mostly. 

\*\*How often and for how long will the dog be left alone?\*\*   

\- The dog will be left alone for at least a 4 hour research period daily and any additional work I might have. Work can take up to 12 hours a day. 

\*\*If needed, could you hire a dog walker, pay for doggy day care, or come home during lunch to take care of your dog?\*\*   - That is certainly an option, particularly coming home at lunch as I do work on uni site. 

 \*\*What is the general location in which you live?\*\* You can decline to answer, but responses will likely assume you‚Äôre somewhere in the US without breed-specific legislation (BSL).  

\-I don't mind. I live in the South-Eastern USA, but I will be moving to the northeastern area soon. I lived in England and Ireland for some time, but I believe that my work in both places is done and I will likely decline any future opportunities.

 \*\*What is the average temperature of a typical summer day where you live? A typical winter day?\*\* Please indicate Celsius or Fahrenheit and the climate of places you may likely live in the future.  

\-Summer/winter, in both my current home and future home, is around 85-95 F and winter is 10-30 F. 

\*\*On a scale of 1 to 10, how prepared are you to care for a dog and prioritize its well-being over your career, entertainment, or other life choices for the next 12 or more years?\*\*  

\- Perhaps a 7-8? I certainly am prepared for the time intensity of raising and training a pup and I am prepared for ensuring daily devotion with the animal, but I can't say that I have much ability to promise myself or the pup that I can give it a 10 at all times.

\*\*Are you aware of the costs associated with dog ownership on an average annual basis? Have you budgeted for additional emergency veterinary care and/or pet insurance?\*\*   

\-As stated above, my father owns a vet clinic so the costs are near minimal and I can allot more funds for a more reputed breeder.

1089,"A little background:

Female 5.5 year old Cockapoo, approx. 20 lbs (in the USA, side note).  Generally has an acidic stomach, but has issues with anxiety that cause her to vomit and have mucusy/runny poop for at least a few days; sometimes with blood in it.  Vet has checked her out multiple times after this happens, and cannot find anything alarming to be the cause.

She did great on Orijen puppy, but once switched to the adult version, she eventually stopped eating it.  She has been on Zignature Trout &amp; Salmon Meal, but was starting to pick at and not eat it more and more frequently up until the most recent bout of vomiting.  Had her on chicken &amp; rice for a few days, but once I started trying to mix in the Zignature (in small amounts!!), she started having horrible diarrhea that did not go away over the course of a 3+ days.  Took her to the vet, and she's finally stabilized after a week on prescription Hill's Science Diet canned food, so it's time to slowly transition her back to normal food, but I'm nervous about putting her back on Zignature now.

A couple of things are making this a hard decision:

1. There is a ton of research out there, and a lot of it conflicts.  Grain free, raw food, etc.  What's legit vs. ""fad diet""?
2. She's been on grain-free food since she was a puppy, but recently the FDA issued a warning that certain grain-free foods with sweet potato or lentils as one of the first 5 ingredients (which is most grain-free foods) could lead to cardiomyopathy...so now that's just another thing to make the search more difficult.
3. Given her sensitive stomach, should she be on a limited ingredient or ""sensitive"" digestion type food?  Are there any drawbacks to these nutritionally?

1090,"EDIT: Too bad I can't edit the typo in the title!

To start off: I don't intend on attempting to make my dog an emotional support animal. This isn't about that.¬†(I could probably greatly benefit from an ESA, but that's an issue for another time)

I have a Mini American Shepherd who is about a year and a half old. She's always been a very well-behaved dog and we have a decent bond, but she's a very independent dog. She does things on her own, in her own space. This definitely has its perks, but I'll be honest and say that it's been incredibly disappointing at times.

When I had chatted (a bunch!) with her breeder\*, I emphasized that I really want a cuddly, affectionate dog. Goodness, all I wanted was a cuddly dog. It may be that my dog's temperament changed after coming home, but I just don't know if I got the dog I wanted (she was picked for me by her breeder). Again, I love my dog and we communicate well and have a good bond, she is just very independent overall. She doesn't seem to understand or relate to my own emotional state - for example, lots of friends, etc, can say that their dog knows when they're sick or not feeling well, but my dog will not have a clue or change her overall behavior. I honestly just strive for a better emotional connection.¬†

(\*Note: Her breeder is excellent and by all means a reputable breeder. Does all of the health tests, shows her dogs, breeds with purpose, participates in breed club things, etc.)

Now, I'm wondering: Is this a temperament thing that can't be changed? Does it have to do with age? I thought that by now she'd start to be more affectionate if it were based on age. Is there anything I can do to encourage a better emotional bond and understanding from her? Any books, videos, etc. that you recommend? What's your experience?¬†

Am I just totally nuts and expecting too much?¬†

Extra information: She is cuddly with other people when I'm not around, like if I'm having a friend watch her for the night or something. Also, I do lots of training with her, I spend all of my time with her when I am home, and I am her human, through and through.

1098,"TL;DR down below!

When I first got my dog from the rescue, they told me she was afraid of bigger dogs, but never that she was aggressive towards them. And for the almost year that I've had her (one year on November 4th!!), she's never had instances where she's been aggressive towards other dogs until recently and it's starting to concern me a bit.

The initial months were fine. She was submissive, and gentle, and all she wanted to do was play. This was when she was about 8 months - 1 yr 2 months. I'm not sure what happened afterwards but she's been much more protective of me, and her space. She now HATES when dogs, especially big ones/ones around her size sniff her private area, and it's beginning to worry me because she gives no warning when she snaps back and gives a lip curl along with a warning nip. I'm not even sure where this came from, but I know she's ALWAYS disliked it when dogs mounted her, but now she doesnt even give dogs the chance. She's become so much more touchy and picky with her friends to the point that she'll only want to play with 2 or 3 dogs, as where she used to be everyone's friend. 

So, of course, I began to do some research and a few sources online told me it was a confidence issue, but they gave me no way to correct it or how to build her confidence around other dogs. I've started giving her treats every time she saw a dog (especially big ones) at the park, and I'm giving it a while before I'll let her greet another big dog, or even medium dog (she won't do it to small dogs, but I don't trust many small dogs anyway). She can only play with dogs I know personally, and if she's off leash (she won't do it if she's off leash either-- I've heard of on-leash tension being a thing.) Another thing is that she sniffs other dogs privates too, especially if they're smaller than her. So she knows it's a normal way of greeting, but she won't let others do it to her. What gives?

So, the question is, how CAN I correct it? She came from a place where she was definitely
not properly socialized as a puppy and it's affecting her now in adulthood, and she's already so wary of strangers that I would hate for her to become aggressive towards dogs too. She plays wonderfully when dogs don't get into her personal space, but that's not something I can control. I can only control my dog, not everyone else's. I've trained her myself and she is a wonderful, sweet dog, but she definitely has some underlying confidence and anxiety issues that make her socially inept at times with other dogs. 

Any advice would help! Thank you!!

TL;DR: 1 yr old dog beginning to snap at dogs who greet her by sniffing her privates, but it's only with big dogs and dogs her size. I believe it's a confidence issue, but I'm not sure how to correct it/train it out of her, or if it's even possible due to her lack of socialization as a puppy (she's a rescue).

I‚Äôve worked at a higher end doggie daycare in central Iowa for the better part of a year now, and I have had nothing but positive experiences with how we run our daycare, and I just want to run you guys thru our processes and daily life. 

We‚Äôre a duo boarding and daycare facility, and our ‚Äúback‚Äù staff works with dogs in both arenas. You begin in boarding and after a few months you train in daycare, and must be vetted by a manager before you can run shifts on your own, the two daycare shifts being 6:45 to noon, and 1:20 to 6:30.

Every dog receives an honest evaluation and assessment of their eligibility for daycare free of charge before they can enter, followed up by a trial day of daycare to make sure the decision to allow them in is correct and that everything is in order. This is free of charge. If the assessment is failed, we offer other services to boost socialization and reassess after. 

We cap our four rooms, lazy, small, medium, and big at 15 dogs, but sometimes we end up with 17-18, not a big deal because we divide dogs up into two groups and practice being calm while action is happening around us. We have one attendant per room and divide the day up into various games and activities thruout.

We have had one incident involving dogs in the entire time I have been here, which concluded in one dog being kicked out of daycare permanently. any sort of aggression is an automatic no no for daycare, and we all train in body language and incident prevention, along with taking preemptive action and keeping notes on which dogs do well/don‚Äôt do well together.

I‚Äôm super proud of what we do, i‚Äôve seen some awesome improvement in socialization and overall demeanor of some of our shakier dogs.

1106,"A little background about my dog, Daniel. He's half German Shepherd and 25% Pitbull and 25% Shar Pei. His dad was a police dog, the German Shepherd, and his mom was the mix. Story from the woman I got him from was that her son had the mom and their next door neighbor had the dad. You can figure out what happened from here.

I noticed something fascinating about my dog a few years ago. He'll be turning 3 on Halloween night, but he's been with me since he was 3 weeks old.

We developed a strong bond very early on. I joke, but he actually didn't want to be with me when I first saw him. His sister did but he didn't. But he grew to love me as did I in him.

Shortly after getting his shots, I began taking him out on walks around the neighborhood. He must have been a little more than 3 months old at the time and I can remember him being a little puppy and still having so much spunk. A man was walking on the opposite side of the street and coming towards us and Daniel didn't hesitate to stand between he and I and didn't move until we were around the corner. Just generally protective of me and everyone else in our household.

A little after his first birthday, I took him for a walk in this park that I wasn't allowed to be in. In this big city of ours was a park along the side of a city, cemented river with a forest-like area. The entrance had been blocked off for some time but people had cut the wires back and people were going in and out like nothing.

I walked through the forest with Daniel on a trail with nothing but big trees surrounding us all around. In front of us was a group of guys sitting on a fallen tree that was blocking the trail. They had a laptop in front of them and seemed to be making a YouTube video. A new trail had been formed on the side so we went up there away from these guys. Down on the side of us was a guy/woman walking a dog. I noticed this before Daniel did and watched Daniel as he finally noticed and he didn't take his eyes off them one bit. He wasn't aggressive, just curious.

We kept walking along and off to the side was a group of palm trees and a dark cave made of trees. In the darkness I could barely make out the silhouette of a man. It was extremely creepy but he didn't seem to be bothering anyone.

We continued along until coming to what appeared to be the end. No more trees, just open skies and the cement river in front of us. So I decided we should turn back.

As we turn back, off to my right side is a hill along the path. Daniel begins barking loudly and violently and looking up the hill. I look up as well and see a man hopping down the hill. Daniel would not take his eyes off the man and would not stop barking. The man stopped halfway down the hill as we passed by and Daniel turned, not letting our backs be to the man.

In situations such as this, I don't scold him as I understand he's being protective, but I won't keep him or myself around so I will pull and motion for him to move along.

Once the guy was out of view, Daniel stopped. I didn't take my eyes off the man either and he stood there staring at us the whole time until we left.

I quickly hurried to the entrance to leave the forest and get back to the green park area. I walked Daniel through the park some more and passed lots of people. Families enjoying the weekend day, couples jogging, people sitting on the bench and smoking... just typical park stuff.

Not a single one did Daniel bark at or appear to be aggressive towards. No one in the forest area either. It was truly bizarre and one of those moments I wish I could see what my dog sees.

Fast forward to a few weekends ago. We've moved recently to a much bigger area, lots of room for Daniel to run and play in, and he loves it as much as I do. Only thing is, I'm admittedly a bit scared because it gets pitch dark out here and we have had some suspicious characters in front of our house. Having Daniel has been a huge relief for me at night time.

But on this particular night, I was feeling hungry for some Taco Bell and didn't want to drive out of my driveway or open the gate so I ordered delivery through PostMates or UberEats or whatever.

I get the notification on my phone that the delivery is very close by so I put my shoes on and head outside to pick up. Daniel, naturally, follows me to the gate to wait. Guy pulls up shortly thereafter and we meet at the gate.

His Prius' headlights are shining into the driveway and I tell Daniel to sit and wait behind me while I go get my order. Daniel usually is very obedient and won't move, but not tonight. Still semi-sitting, he gets up and moves closer, inching closer behind me. As the guy hands the bag over the gate, I hear Daniel let out an audible growl. Mouth closed, but loud enough that we could hear it within feet of him. I pet him on the head but he's in his mode and not coming out. Eyes fixed on the man, ears up, no blinking...ready for anything out of the ordinary and to act.

Man leaves and I go inside with my food.

I chalked it up to him just being protective of me from an unknown person as he usually is. He barks at anyone and everyone who passes by. Oddly enough, he seems smart enough to know the mailman isn't a threat and no longer barks at him. But he will anyone else who is unfamiliar.

Fast forward to tonight and I have an old mattress and boxspring I need to get rid of. I don't know where I'm going to put this stuff, so it's been left in front of our house for the longest.

I dialed one of those companies who comes out to pick up junk. It's pretty dark outside, as it usually is, but Daniel is sitting with me and enjoying the pets and attention I'm giving him.

Shortly thereafter, the big truck pulls in the driveway and two guys get out. I'm outside the gate and tell Daniel to sit. He does and kinda moves around back and forth behind the gate.

The guy gets close to me and we shake hands. He makes a comment about Daniel afterwards, ""I love his colors"" and then correctly guesses German Shepherd and Pitbull before I name them off.

The whole time this man is here, Daniel makes no peep or aggressive tone. He's calm as ever, smiling with his panting, ears back, eyes blinking normally, and just normal. The guys pick up the junk and then leave after payment. Daniel never makes a sound and just goes back as if nothing happened.

I'm just in shock over this behavior. He seems to pick and choose various people based on...something...and acts on it and doesn't act on others who he sees nothing?

It's such strange behavior and I'm just not sure what to think except be in awe of it all.

My dad and I talked more about it tonight and my dad told me about his own theory, based on anecdotal evidence, of our first family dog who he loved. My dad says that that dog would get excited when my dad would reach for the leash under the kitchen sink. The dog would be outside, behind a door with closed windows, yet my dad would hear the dog jumping around and dancing with an energetic tone. My dad is convinced that dogs are somehow telepathic and pick up stuff about us humans that we can't pick up on about one another. It's absolutely incredible and I love hearing about stories like this because it never ceases to amaze me.

What intrigued me more tonight was thinking about Daniel's genealogy, or what little I know of it. His dad was a police dog and received tons of training.

1113,"Hi - Our lovely whippet girl pup is six months old. 3 weeks ago there was an accident at doggie daycare where another dog landed on her breaking her front leg :(.

Prior to the accident our pup was sleeping through the night, locked in her crate. She had a good relationship with the crate and would sleep in it during the day at her leisure, and otherwise had the run of the kitchen. All good.

After the accident and surgery, pup is now on crate rest. This means keeping pup in her crate at any time we are not directly interacting with her on lead i.e. 18 - 20 hours per day.

She now hates the crate, understandably, with our best efforts to make It a happy place falling on deaf ears. I can deal with the whining and barking during the day when she is locked up... but at night life has become impossible for us. The pup will wake up at two hour intervals and cry/bark/mewl endlessly (hours) until we let her out to go to the toilet. Then we will get another 2 hours of peace. This has happened since we picked her up from surgery.

Our vet surgeon doesn't seem bothered - he is understandably more concerned with her leg healing than any behavioural issues. 

We have tried restricting water, walks before bed, making the crate cozier, restricting sleep before bedtime, adaptil spray, ignoring her (She will eventually wee/poo in crate). She has also torn the door off one of our crates with her teeth one night.

So basically is there anything more we can do or do we just have to put up with this for eight weeks? ",[Help] Whippet puppy on crate rest now won't sleep at night,dogs

1118,"Alright, so some context first: I‚Äôm watching my neighbors pugs for the next 2 weeks while they‚Äôre on a trip. I‚Äôm living at their house for the time being, making sure their two pugs (and one fish) are okay. I feed them, let them out, keep them company, etc.

Anyways, to my problem. I came home from work yesterday and noticed one of the pugs hadn‚Äôt ran up to me to say hi. She just sat there with her leg twitching. When she got up, she wouldn‚Äôt put any weight on it. I checked to see if she hurt herself, but didn‚Äôt see anything. Nor did she make any reactions when I touched her leg.

1125,"My mom often winds up with dogs that other folks don't want or can't keep, in addition to our own coonhounds. One such dog is a little mutt named Mocha. She's small, about 8lbs. We've had her about a year.

This dog has gotten extremely attached to me for some reason, I'm only home a couple times a year (live in a different state), but this dog screams and throws a complete fit of happiness every time she sees me. Sleeps in my bed, follows me around the house. The joke in my family is that she's a reincarnation of a former dog of mine.  Apparently she behaves similarly with my mom in terms of being a velcro dog, but it's next level with me, even though she's only seen me a handful of times. For financial reasons I'm moving home for a couple months to save some money, and will have time to spend with the dog.

We got Mocha from an elderly friend of my mom's who had to go into hospice and has since passed away. I believe outside of nursing staff and the previous owner, that she has never been exposed to other people or taken outside the household. She's a sweet little dog, but my mom and I have had some discussion about me taking her with me when I leave home again, seeing how attached she is to me. For work I will likely be living in an apartment situation in a major metro area, so not being able to handle life outside the house (as opposed to currently having complete run of the house and a fenced in yard in a rural area on quite a bit of acreage) would be a huge barrier for her well being and my sanity.

1130,"I'm considering giving up my dog. There's a complicated backstory so let me start with that. 

In high school I saw a dog up for adoption outside a shopping center, I thought he was cute and I mentioned to my step mom ""oh my gosh hes so cute can we please adopt him!?"" she said that her and my dad had been wanting another dog anyways so we adopted him, his name is Pluto. He was 4 years old when we got him. He's a terrier-mix. We were lied to. We were told he's calm,  and house broken. That's so far from the truth. Once I graduated from high school my dad said ""So what are you going to do with your dog?"" up until this point he was never ""my"" dog he was labeled as the ""family"" dog. 

They kept him for two years while I was in college but one day I got a call and my dad said ""Your brother is going to drop off Pluto with you, we don't want him anymore."" He has always had behavioral issues. He is terrified of everything, very needy and clingy, has accidents when left alone for too long, and doesn't get along well with other dogs. I couldn't keep him as my landlord didn't allow pets and I was a broke college student who couldn't up and move whenever. My mom LOVES animals and she offered to take him in until we came up with a solution. She couldn't handle his behavioral issues and I told her to put him up for adoption since I couldn't take him in. She refused. She kept him for about a year, it caused a lot of fights and eventually I was able to take him back. I had moved in with my boyfriend who has two cats and the landlords said they would allow a third. If I'm being honest I didn't really want to take him back. I'm 21 and I don't want that responsibility. 

Now we have moved to Germany and we have taken our pets with us. It was a lot of work but we did it! We unfortunately had to move into the outskirts because very few apartments here allow dogs. Pluto hasn't been causing too many issues but I've been getting resentful. He has accidents, he's needy, I can't hang out with my friends because I have to go home and walk him right after class. I can't go on vacations with my boyfriend because getting him into a pet hotel basically doubles the cost of the trip (his cats can be left alone for a weekend and they're fine with just extra water and food). 

Here's the big issue, our landlords who live below us told us today that he cries loudly every day when we're gone. I don't know how to fix this and honestly I don't have the time or money. I'm a student and my course load is only going to get heavier and heavier. I'm going to try some things to help alleviate the situation but if they don't work.... I don't know what to do. I'll have to give him up for adoption. 

Let me clarify, I'm not a bad dog owner. I walk him 3-5 times a day, he has plenty of toys and he is well taken care of (he wasn't at my dads, just left in the backyard 24/7)

-We have tried putting his favorite treats (kong with frozen peanut butter or kibble, etc) and he just won't go in. 
-I have tried methods I've seen online of letting him explore and working up to closing the door, but the major issue here is that even when we make a little progress, he still has to be crated at night and when we leave so I feel like we take 20 steps backwards every single day.

 I'm hard pressed to see any pug but maybe she just didn't get a lot from that parent. Temperament wise she's very sweet and loving with people but tends to bully other dogs (trying to train her out of it). She adores food and is pretty lazy. Her favourite thing seems to be to cuddle up next to me and start snoring. Which I know are all features of pugs but also of a senior dog and many other small breeds.

1141,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* My experiences with dogs are poor, because my family didn't want to take care of the two they got. I am older, more determined and no longer live with my family, so I'd say a small bit of experience.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* There are mostly just pitbull mixes at the shelters near here, sadly. I'd be willing to invest the time into a puppy/go the breeder route, but adults are great so long as they can somehow meet my requirements.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Large/Medium, fluffy dog. Non-aggressive and low energy that can live in an apartment. Can be trained to know basic obedience and good leash manners, polite towards strangers. There will be 1 young child around that the dog must be good with, but the child will be taught to be respectful towards the dog as well. Does not bark a lot.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I love almost all fluffy, medium/large dogs. In the past I've adored German Shepherds and Australian Shepherds. However I fear that these types of dogs are too high energy and I would not be able to handle them, so I've looked at Chow chows/Rough Collies/Newfoundlands instead, trying to find a lower-energy large dog. They all seem good, but Chowchows are supposedly aggressive and the other two are still apparently high energy?

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* BE GOOD ON A LEASH. I am a smaller person, so I want to be able to control my dog. I also want them to know basic obedience, such as sitting and laying down. However the smarter the better- I'd love to have my dog around my friends and have them do tricks, or give them mental stimulation during the day.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* I'm around all day and do most of my work on the computer, but the dog can be in that space with me. I'll be happy to relax every hour to half an hour and give them some attention for a few minutes, take them on the schedules walks, and during the later parts of the day I can give tons of time to them. Any affection they need, I can and will happily give, and I can adjust even my work schedule to that.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* Since I live in an apartment, I'm willing to take them out 3-4 times a day for doing their business and walking. If it's a puppy, I know it will be more than that. I'd rather not have them be walking/running around a long time, but 15 minutes for each of those times is acceptable. I'm willing to have one of those sessions be extended up to 30 minutes realistically. I don't know of any nearby dog parks unfortunately, it would be a rare treat.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* I'd love to brush my dog often, at least once a day even, especially if they end up enjoying it. I'm not sure how to trim hair, but I can clean their ears and do anything other than what should be left to groomers specifically. I do not want to pay to send my dog to a groomers. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium or Large.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Very little barking. It has to be able to be trained out of them. Shedding is zero problem. Slobber is not wanted, but a very little could be tolerated and cleaned.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Not important, but there is a large open area around that could be good for the dog to run about, which would I assume be better off-leash. Unfortunately it's near some roads, so it could be dangerous as well. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Snuggly. I want a stranger to be able to hug my dog and be safe doing so. If the dog prefers personal space to the point of growling at a hug, it has to be able to be trained out of them, or they'll have to tolerate the affection to include strangers.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Either one, so long as I can train them well. If a dog wants its space, I won't force it to be around me all the time.

14) How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Ideally they would not care, and realistically I'd be fine with them being alert, or giving off a single bark at most. Greeting strangers they may be affectionate, but jumping will never be tolerated. My goal is to get the most polite dog as possible.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* I'd really, really rather not. But if it happens, it happens and I'd do my best to try to socialize them at a dog park or something.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Lots of barking. Lots of tugging at the leash. Lots of energy and high exercise needs.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* Almost never. I will watch over them all the time, and there are other people in the house they'll see often.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* They have zero preferences so long as they don't ruin the house and aren't aggressive/very loud. They'll be somewhat helpful in walking the dog and will maybe give them some affection, but I want to take care of the dog mostly myself.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* Yes. Multiple cats will be involved(not mine), all domestic shorthairs. I also have a Blue Tongue Skink, but none of the animals are ever allowed near him and aren't allowed to touch his terrarium. I will not have any other animals after I get the dog, I want all the attention on them.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* One child yes. I plan to socialize them at a children's park that's 20 minutes away to prepare them for the 1 child at home.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No restrictions.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* No laws on any breeds in my area.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer can get around the 80s-90s on extremely hot days. Winters can get to around the zeros on extremely cold days.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* High energy and lots of barking or aggression will make it impossible for me to have a dog. So I need to work around this somehow. I have all the time in the world, and I have quite a lot of money saved even for emergencies, but if it gets too expensive I might end up regretting it. As I stated right away my family got 2 high energy dogs and didn't want to take care of them/train them, so I can't allow this to happen to myself. I want to make a dog happy and be happy with my animal.

1142,"My pup is about 10 months old now and I really want to put together a better diet for her when we translation away from puppy food. Im having a hard time navigating all of the different sites and recommendations, though. 

A couple of concerns I have: 

1. My pup has a pretty sensitive stomach when it comes to switching her food. We tried to move her to a better food when we first got her and no matter how slowly we did it, she would get diarrhea anytime there was new food in her bowl. She does fine with raw vegetables and plain boiled chicken.

2. Her skin has been very dry, itchy, and flaky to the point where she‚Äôs chewing fur off on her legs. The vet confirmed it‚Äôs not any kind of skin infection and recommend rubbing her down with coconut oil and balancing out her diet. The coconut oil seems to have helped a lot but I still want to address the underlying problem.

3. She eats EVERYTHING. I know that she‚Äôs a puppy and a high-chew breed (lab and golden retriever) but she will eat and then poop out anything she can get her mouth on. I try to monitor this as closely as possible but sometimes she still eats stuff she shouldn‚Äôt. When I was researching dog diets, a few articles mentioned that a nutritionally lacking diet can cause pica. Does this sound like pica or like I just need to keep a better eye on my pup?

Some things I‚Äôd like y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinions on:

1. Do you have a good quality mid-range priced dog food that you would recommend? 

2. Do you have any tips for finding this dog food myself? (Ingredients I should look for both to avoid and to make sure it includes)

3. Do you have any advice about making the switch easier for her this time?

4. What are your opinions on supplements and which would you recommend or stay away from for sure?

5. Should I start transitioning her to a better puppy diet now and then transition her again in a couple of months when she‚Äôs one? I don‚Äôt mind doing that if it‚Äôs what‚Äôs best but it worries me trying to transition her twice because of her stomach. So should I stick out these last couple of months on her current diet, or transition her to what will be her long-term diet as soon as possible?

First time paranoid dog mom checking in! I have an Australian Cattle Dog mix who obviously requires a lot of exercise and loves to play with other dogs. I've taken him to the dog park a couple times because he needs to run and the only place I can do that in my city is in an off leash dog park. The dog park near me is quiet and we only encounter a couple dogs at most. My issue is that, in typical cattle dog fashion, he automatically starts nipping at every dog's legs as they start to run with him. To me it's pretty obvious that he's playing - he play bows and jumps around in circles - but a dog he was playing with today was obviously put off by his nipping and starting growling and baring his teeth. We separated them and went back to playing one on one but now I'm incredibly nervous about letting him off leash around other dogs in case this triggers an angry response.

There is one small problem, which I have tried many things to sort. Every time he is excited, even the tiniest bit, he pees! 

To stop him doing it in the house, as soon as we walk in the house he goes out side where we greet him and he will pee. The kids know not to get him to excited in the house, so generally he is fine. We do have to odd accident but it's rare.

1150,"First off, my dog lives a great life. I got her at 8 weeks. We go on long walks almost daily. We were in OKC for the summer where everything was dog friendly. She came everywhere with me. She gets expensive food, expensive bones, expensive treats. I make my work day longer by coming home halfway through the day to let her out. I recently rearranged my furniture so she could sit on my bed and look out the window because she loves doing that. I spend time training her too.

But she was such a let down in so many ways. For example, I love having a dog sleep with me. My childhood dogs always did. My dog (8 months) might grow out of it but as of now she can't sleep with me. She won't settle down unless you put her in her crate. She also has every irrational fear you could imagine. We work VERY hard on these things. I'll buy whatever she's scared of to work on it. Balloons, suitcases, umbrellas, skateboards, you name it. It does get exhausting. She recently became scared of strangers touching her and it breaks my heart. I don't know where it came from. My only guess is too many vet visits where they touch her and then do uncomfortable stuff. She runs up to strangers wagging her tail and then runs away when they try to pet her. It's so embarrassing. She never gets hit or yelled at. Yet she acts like she gets beaten daily. Meanwhile she constantly wants to be touched by people she knows. I don't get it. This is even without talking about the more normal things like all my bleongings she's ruined and the fact that I now have to be up at 7:30am on the weekends because that's when she wants out of the crate. 

All of these issues don't even mention all the money I've spent for the multiple times she ate things she shouldn't or the time she jumped off a hill and pretended to break her leg (she was just scared and the vet brought her back in walking after the X-ray). Like a thousand dollars at least has gone into vet appointments not including shots and regular appointments.

I'm sorry about this rant but it's so much for me to deal with. All of these behavioral problems make me wish I had gone a breeder route where I could have expected a certain temperment. She is a super mutt and I can barely guess her breed. Veterinarians don't even know. Maybe a gsd/blue heeler/lab? She mainly looked lab when I adopted her just with weird coloring. The only thing that makes me not regret getting her is realizing she's the type of dog that ends up at shelters because she's too hard to manage. She wants to kill every small animal but is scared of a plastic bag blowing across the lawn. Even after me socializing her hardcore. What would she have been like in a normal household? So at least I did some good. 

Also, I have no thoughts to give her up for adoption. I love her a lot. I literally cried bringing her home from getting spayed because she looked so sad and cried when I thought she broke her leg. I care about her very much. I just wanted to get this off my chest. I could deal with the normal puppy destruction because that's what I signed up for. But all this together is so exhausting. Judge me if you want but people can also hate their children when they are first born. I also take really good care of my dog. I'm just sad that I worked so hard to socialize her and take care of her but she's still a mess. Also, the behavioral specialists by me cost $1000 and I've already spent far too much the last three months on accidents to be able to afford it right now. She has gotten over fears one at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

&amp;#x200B;

\* This will be my first dog, but my family did have a Wheaton Terrier growing up

&amp;#x200B;

2)	Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a \[reputable breeder\]( [http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html))?

&amp;#x200B;

\* No preference

&amp;#x200B;

3)	Describe your ideal dog.

&amp;#x200B;

\* Low shedding, low-medium energy, friendly, likes to cuddle and relax. I would like to take the dog on walks and play with him, but I would prefer not too much energy to the point  where he wants to play all the time or when we're trying to watch movies or go to bed.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend owns a house with a fenced in back yard and plenty of room to play. My dog would probably be at my apartment 50% of the time and her house 50% of the time, so I would also like to make sure this won't confuse my dog as to who it's owner is (more like mom and dad type of thing).

&amp;#x200B;

4)	What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

&amp;#x200B;

\* -I was very interested in the Goldendoodle until I did more research and learned that they're very unpredictable in health issues and temperament/personality because of the mix. I read ""why not get a poodle or retriever?"" For me, the shedding of a Golden would be too much to handle. I personally don't think standards poodles are cute at all.

\-I've also been looking at Wheaton's, and Maltese's (Almost too small for me).

&amp;#x200B;

5)	What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I don't plan on training my dog to do much more than the basic commands (sit, stay, lay down, come, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Care Commitments\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I can devote 30-60 minutes each day training/playing with my dog. I can devote an hour or two of cuddling/watching tv and would let him sleep in my bed if he wants.

&amp;#x200B;

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I can exercise my dog for 30-60 minutes a day. I live 2 blocks from a dog park and a few blocks from a nice lake to walk around.

&amp;#x200B;

8)	How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I'm open to any grooming at home and also willing to pay for professional grooming as often as needed. I wouldn't mind brushing my dog a few times a week

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Personal Preferences\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

9)	What size dog are you looking for?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would prefer a medium dog, but would also be open to a medium-small or medium-large dog.

&amp;#x200B;

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

&amp;#x200B;

\* I would prefer very minimal shedding (hence why I was looking at Goldendoodles), minimal barking, and minimal slobber.

&amp;#x200B;

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

&amp;#x200B;

\* Not important.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dog Personality and Behavior\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

&amp;#x200B;

1154,"I have a 17 year old pup who has recently decided not to eat. He is usually food crazy. I'm know his teeth aren't great, but the weird thing is he will still eat crunchy treats or something like toast. Although, we are REALLY trying to avoid giving scraps. 

We have got multiple kibbles (tiny size for example) and wet food (shredded, chunk, etc) and he won't eat. He won't eat after/before his pain medication either. He sniffs around like he is wanting to find food, but then is almost repulsed when it comes near him. He isn't thrilled about liquified stuff either. However, he drinks water fine. 

Is this his way of letting go and passing on? Is it worth seeing a vet (we would opt out of *most* medical intervention at this point anyway) or is this normal, end-of-days stuff?

Is this a case of me being ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have the money don‚Äôt get a dog‚Äù, or is crating while I‚Äôm at work ok? Both of us are well enough off to take care and they‚Äôd be in a very loving home with a yard, toys, vet trips, and the sort, but just that monthly expense seems extravagant.

Ive always wanted a dog but my parents are convinced that I won‚Äôt be able to handle it. I don‚Äôt walk a lot for pleasure because yes, it‚Äôs a bit of a hassle but I feel like it‚Äôd be worth it with a companion.

1167,"###Hey Guys!
&amp;nbsp;
I am a graphic designer and pastel/charcoal artist as well as an animal lover! As a side gig, I do pet portrait drawings. As my day job is designing shirts at a screen printing company, I thought I would marry my strengths together and design some dog themed shirts.
&amp;nbsp;
The two designs I am planning on feature a **Chef Dog** and a **Side Eye Dog**. I had considered just using some stock art as a reference, but I thought it might be fun to open up submissions for people to post their dogs! 
&amp;nbsp;
##The Good Bits!
&amp;nbsp;
If your photo is selected for one of the designs, I will send you a digital copy of the artwork featuring your pup! Also, if at least 12 shirts are ordered, I will send you a shirt with the design your dog inspired! I will have it shipped for free as long as you are in the continental US. You can still enter if you are not in the continental US, and you can still get a free shirt, but there will be a small fee to cover shipping depending on your location.
&amp;nbsp;
##Rules
&amp;nbsp;
1. You must either own the dog or be fostering the dog to enter its picture. Please do not send me photos of other people's pets.
&amp;nbsp;
2. You must have taken the photo yourself.
&amp;nbsp;
3. Tell me which design you are submitting your pet for. They don't have to be wearing any props but a chef's hat might help.
&amp;nbsp;
4. Tell me about your pet! I love rescue dogs, and if the dog is up for adoption I would be happy to include information to adopt them when I advertise the shirt.
&amp;nbsp;
5. Please do **NOT** make your dog do/wear something that makes then uncomfortable in order to get a good picture.
&amp;nbsp;
6. The photograph needs to be a decent quality in order for me to use it as a reference, and should feature the dog's face primarily. 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

If you submit a photo of your dog, you are giving me permission to use it as a reference in a commercial design.

1172,"**Introduction**

* **Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?**
   * For me, my second dog, for my husband, his third or fourth. While he grew up in a house that always had a dog, I only had a dog for about 6 months before moving out of my parents' house, he stayed with them.
* **Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a** [**reputable breeder**](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)**?**
   * Rescuing, definitely.
* **Describe your ideal dog.**
   * I'd want them to cuddle with us on the couch after a long day, and maybe sleep with us if they feel like it, but also to go out for runs with me, and to play with us at the dog friendly parks nearby. I'd also want them to be smart enough to learn complex tricks. That's about it, everything else is up to chance.
* **What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?**
   * I am quite interested in retrievers, since they're medium-large size, smart and quite cuddly, but we've talked about getting bigger dogs, such as greyhound or great dane, we've considered boxer and bull similar breeds as well simply because they look adorable.
* **What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?**
   * The basic sit, lay, stay, fetch, but also ring a bell to ask to go to the bathroom, play dead, speak, whisper, jump on my back, cover itself with blanket, some agility training, and several others, but my favorite is that we want it to bring a throw pillow or plushie for anyone that visits us, we saw someone doing it as a bark inhibitor but we just think it's absolutely adorable.

**Care Commitments**

* **How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?**
   * While my husband works at the station, I work from home, and I'm willing to only work part time or less for about 6 months after we get our new dog to give it enough attention and training so it is well exercised, housebroken, and it knows what it is allowed to do or not, after that, I'm still going to be working from home, so I'm always available to interact with them. In regards to actual playing and training, we'll definitely reserve 2 to 3 hours for walking each day, a trip to a closed park for playing every day or so, and training will take several 10min spurts throughout the day, every day. We also know to buy toys and items that stimulate the dog mentally, since we're looking for a smart dog
* **How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?**
   * We have several parks and dog parks nearby we can easily get to, so we're willing to play outdoors with our dog every day, but in regards to just walking, I walk with my husband to his workplace and then jog back, and then pick him up later in the day, and we'd like to use those routes for the dog as well. All in all it'd be about 2 to 3 hours of walking every day, with a small portion of running. There are two or three dog parks nearby that we're super excited to take our dog to as well!
* **How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?**
   * I grew up with cats, and my husband with dogs, so we're quite comfortable with the idea of trimming nails, brushing hair, cleaning ears, cleaning eyes and nose, etc. We'd leave hairdressing for professionals since we don't wanna mess up our dog's coat.

**Personal Preferences**

* **What size dog are you looking for?**
   * We're open, but we prefer medium to big
* **How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?**
   * Shedding is fine, slobber is okay in medium amounts, and barking is probably a no-no since we live in an apartment, although we're willing to teach it barking inhibitors
* **How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?**
   * Not that important, but we'd like to have the ability of doing so in case an accident or emergency happens (we once saw a guy walking his dog and the leash broke and the dog just bolted, so I reeeeally wouldn't like that)

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

* **Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?**
   * Absolutely a snuggly dog! We wanna cuddle with it on the couch, we wanna sleep with it, we wanna hug it and teach it to hug back (husband's parents' dog does it and it's adorable), we want the dog to be so happy when it sees my husband when we go pick him up! The cuddliest the better
* **Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?**
   * Eager to please
* **How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?**
   * I'd prefer a dog that greets someone knocking on the door by giving it throw pillows, which means; I'd like a friendly dog. But maybe also smart enough to know when to bark in an obviously bad situation
* **Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?**
   * We don't have experience with that situation, although we're willing to try
* **Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?**
   * Aggressiveness towards children and runners. We're also gonna try to get it to stop barking or chasing squirrels, since we have squirrels at our building that we feed sometimes

**Lifestyle**

* **How often and how long will the dog be left alone?**
   * Not often at all, maybe during the weekends or when we're doing groceries shopping, but never for longer than 4 hours at a time once a week. We also have a roommate that could keep it company. We do go to anime and game events every once in a while, but we only stay out for about 5 hours for 3 days straight every like... 4 months or so.
* **What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?**
   * Our roommate loves dogs, but he's not willing to do any high maintenance care for a pet that's not his
* **Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?**
   * We have no pets, but are planning on getting a cat
* **Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?**
   * No, no children for these guys, and none of our friends or closeby family have kids
* **Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?**
   * We're renting right now, and we're still not aware of breed or weight restrictions although we know the building allows dogs since we see them a lot

1173,"Hello fellow dog lovers! I adopted a 2 year old coonhound about a year ago who was from South Carolina. The shelter didn‚Äôt have much info about him and said he was good with other dogs/ cats. 80% of the time, he‚Äôs a very high energy and very loving pup. 20% of the time, he‚Äôs a completely different dog. Brought him home to my older lab and my cat, and he absolutely lost it trying to get to the cat. We kept them separated and tried for a few weeks to slowly introduce them but just the sight of the cat would turn him into another dog. He would shake, bark, cry, pace, and there would be no getting through to him for a good few hours. Eventually, i moved my cat to my friends house so the cat could continue living a happy life. Even so, if a cat walks past our house, or goes near our yard, crazy dog is back. This also happens if he hears certain bells or ringing noises (for example, ice cubes clanging in a glass will set him straight off). At first I thought it was just sounds similar to a cat collar bell, but even certain ring tones will set him off.
He loves other dogs and has no problem with squirrels or bunnies or any creature that we‚Äôve come across that isn‚Äôt a cat. Does anyone have any idea what this poor guys life was before we adopted him that would make him so reactive to cats/certain noises? My heart goes out to him. If it was all furry creatures, it would be one thing, but this seems so specific that I was hoping someone might have an idea. We even brought a trainer in with 30 years of experience and she was like, he‚Äôs a great dog!

1175,"Generally, I don't want to sound like I'm ranting. I've already ranted about it. It's ridiculous.   


My dog, a nice 40-lb mix is pretty much an overall family dog. I've gotten him out a lot more, and we've really bonded as friends, but everyone I know is going to complain about his bad breath. I moved in maybe a year or two ago and, well, it's   
a process caring for the guy and both of us getting back in shape. We take a run a few times a week at most and he's in love. He's seen mostly just places around the house and the backyard in his entire fifteen year stay since a puppy. I feel obligated to take him out on a date. Lol

&amp;#x200B;

Since he's fifteen, or so, and never has he ever been to a vet's office, I think I'm going to pull a few of his teeth. Like, an incisor and a bottom incisor. My experiences so far with the vet is that they will rough my dog up, though. I remember this when I was younger, too, the way the vets had stormed into the room with the steel table and did a lot of yelling and it wasn't pleasant at all. This was when I had a large dog. Sadly, he passed on. I find it hard to settle down the vet. They are on a mission, it seems.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't gotten much customer relations with, well, any vets since then and either they want to steal my dog into a room and operate on him without my permission. My opinion matters, right? And, I can stay in that room. 

Hell, my dog is full on comfortable with my holding my hand and scrubbing his teeth with my finger nails or a tooth brush and mostly flossing, but he is used to it.  I scrapped the idea since I really had nothing to say to them if they couldn't even begin a bartering process, but I really haven't searched for a vet since then. Anyways, suffice to say, I think my dog is going to lose his teeth and the vets are pretending to refuse service even though I'm caring deeply for my pets health and mine and care about what goes into our bodies, what works for us, etc.","[discussion] Dogs, their teeth in old age and experiences with the vet",dogs

1177,"Hello.

My dog is a M√ºnsterl√§nder which is a hunting dog, however he has been the family dog and has never been used or trained for hunting. He is very friendly and is sometimes scared of flies. He has never willingly harmed a human or other dog before.


However he rather recently (hes currently 8 years old) killed a rat and a bird (with a few months inbetween). Not a big deal.

He used to live with a cat. The cat was already old-ish when we got him. After getting him used to it they both lived happily togheter. They even ate from the same bowl and slept next to eachother sometimes. 
The cat later died from a kidney failure due to dehydration after being missing for a week. Dog was about 2-3 when that happend and we havent had a cat since.

Dog never chased the cat while inside but sometimes did when they were outside (mostly cause the cat ran a lot outside and never really stayed in our garden to begin with) however even when he got close to the cat outside after chasing it he never actually did anything to it, only looked at it. 

He always chased cats however with him recently killing small animals (only 2 in 8 years but still) I started to wonder if he would actually kill a cat ( or at least one that doesn't belong to us. ) I understand that its an animal so he might kill it just cause its a foreign animal. Would he kill a cat outside of ""his territory"" aswell and would we ever be able to get another cat while hes alive? 


I know personality doesnt really come into play here since we are mostly talking about instinct but the dog himself is really kind and nice. As soon as he knows whatever hes looking at isnt an immediate threat hell usually greet is very nicely and usually gets really happy. He also never barked at another dog and usually gets scared when other dogs bark at him. I almost expect a cat to scare him off when its cornered but I know thats probably not how it might go down.


Well, my question really is: How far can I trust my dog to not kill someone else's pet? A lot of our neighbors have cats and some of them sometimes walk through our garden.


EDIT:
More context:

The rat was running at my mum and she got scared (jumped up and stuff) so it was more or less protecting her.

But that aside, I've gotten it off of her and I'm pretty certain I got the head but the area looks pretty irritated. Granted I just pulled it off and got a few patches of fur with it too so I expect it to be a bit irritated for a little while, I just want to be safe.  Vets are closed today so until then: there is what looks to be a pea sized scab right next to where the tick was. It's a little bloody and swollen around the area but like I said, it was difficult to get off so I got a little bit of her fur with it.  I wiped her with an alcohol pad after.

1185,"Hello.  I have a 7 year old Lab/Shar-Pei mix named Pete.  [Obligatory photo tax](https://imgur.com/a/Eg7C3uQ).  

He generally eats [Nutro Limited Ingredient](https://www.petsmart.com/dog/food/dry-food/nutroandtrade-limited-ingredient-diet-dog-food---natural-grain-free-non-gmo-lamb-and-sweet-potato-5264017.html) because of some allergy issues he had when he was younger, but I'm about 2 days away from being out of that and I don't get paid again for over a week.


My question is will he be okay eating mainly brown rice, pinto beans, and potatoes(that's basically everything I have in my pantry) for the majority of a week?  I just started rationing what food he has left so he can at least get a half cup of that + 1.5 cups of beans and rice as his 2x daily meal.  

I know the normal recommendation is chicken and rice, but I don't have any meat around and can't afford it.  I'm sorry if this is rambling, I'm just worried about him and angry at myself for getting into this situation.   He's basically all I have in this world.

I have looked into charities and because of my location there are none nearby.  I'm in Douglas City, CA at the moment and I don't have the gas to make it to the nearest real city, Redding, which is 40 miles away.  

Any suggestions are welcome, though I believe my options are pretty limited by my location/lack of anything resembling money.  I guess what I'm looking for more is just assurance that this won't hurt Pete. 

-----------Edited to add more information --------------------

I've taken stock of my finances and I've got about $4 that I can spare if that is of any help to supplement his food with something.  My shopping options are limited to a small town grocery store(decent selection but not the cheapest.  Think Kroger-lite) or a CVS(small pharmacy/general store).  

-------------FINAL EDIT----------------------

Due to the generosity of strangers it looks like Pete and I will be okay until payday :)   I will leave this post up because there is some good advice here for anyone in a similar situation.

When I was younger I was quite a cynic in life but the kindness and empathy of strangers has really given me hope for the future in recent times.  Thank you all for your support!

1186,"So first, appearance (suggest a dog that‚Äôs best for me and suggest a dog that‚Äôs the best for me plus appearance cus I know the best dog for me probably won‚Äôt have the appearance I want). I want a big dog with long fur, but I don‚Äôt really like curly or wavy fur.

Second, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty lazy but I can spend an hour and a half taking my dog on a walk everyday, maybe just one hour tho.

Loud noises won‚Äôt be so good, since we might have to live in an apartment.

I have a short temper but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a very patient person when it comes to pets.

I have 7 years of experience with dogs (I took care and helped take care of chihuahuas). I helped take care of 2 chihuahuas for 4 yrs, then we got another one and so I took care of all three for 2 more years (that‚Äôs 6 years), then we got a batch of 5 puppies, sold 3, and kept 2, making that 5 puppies in total. Kept all 5 for a year (7 years). Since I have a lot of experience, I think I‚Äôm fine when it comes to training, though I don‚Äôt want a dog that‚Äôs TOO independent.

I L O V E snuggles and cuddling but I also want to take hikes and go swimming every once in a while. We also might travel a few times a year so I want to make sure the breed I get isn‚Äôt illegal in ANY places. I want my dog to be very affectionate and loyal, and if we ever need protection I want the dog to help me out.

I‚Äôm a full time student so I want my dog to be able to be happy with 8 hrs of alone time every weekday.

My sister is allergic to dogs, but she‚Äôll take allergy medicine like she did for those whole 7 years, so I dog with a moderate amount of shedding won‚Äôt hurt. I‚Äôm interested in dogs with heavy shedding (I‚Äôm pretty sure I can handle it) but a dog with moderate shedding should be okay for my sister.

Me, one person, will be in charge of taking care of the dog most of the time. but keep in mind I‚Äôm below the age 18.

I don‚Äôt want a dog with much health issues. That‚Äôs actually one of my biggest problems when picking a dog breed. And the highest amount of money I can pay for dog food a month would be $20.

I‚Äôd brush my dogs fur everyday even if he was low maintenance, I‚Äôm fine with clipping nails, checking ears, and instead of brushing his teeth 3 times a week I‚Äôll brush em once everyday. Bathing isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm really into though...

In this situation I live in the same area as I do now, expect it's a few years in the future, I love alone and am a student in university

Introduction

Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?
Uhh technically yes. We have 2 family dogs so I know how to take care of a dog, but have never independently owned a dog. Our dogs dont have any special training, only basic stuff like ""sit"".

Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a¬†reputable breeder?
A breeder is more reliable for getting what you want but I'm not against a rescue in any way. 

Describe your ideal dog.
Like no limits ideal? Smart, learns commands relatively easily. Semi active, would go on a run with me but doesnt need 4h exercise every day. Friendly and gets along with other dogs.

What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why? 
Not considering my life circumstances, border collie, collie, golden retriever and poodle. But I know these dogs are very intelligent and need lots of attention and activity, so realistically I would not be a good owner for them.

What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?
Quite basic stuff. Sit, fetch, stay, follow..

Care Commitments

How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?
Depends on the day. Weekdays, maybe 0,5-1h of training if im not super busy then some playing, walks and just petting and casual interaction. I tend to interact with our family dogs a lot even if I dont train them. Weekends? I would gladly do things like agility for a few hours each day, then walks, maybe a run, playing etc.

How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?
Dog parks, yes if I live near one. I do right now but our dogs are not very social with other dogs and dont enjoy being there. (Keep in mind i was like 9 when we got them so i didnt really have a say in their training) I do exercise myself, so I would gladly run maybe 4~ times a week for 30-60 minutes depending on the speed. And obviously a 30~ minute walk in the morning and evening. A little shorter in the afternoon and just before bed a short 5 minute pee walk. 
For what I know of the hobby possibilities in the area, I could do agility a few times a week. And during vacations in the summer I would love to have a dog hiking with me.

How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?
I am open to general grooming, nothing super duper special though. I dont mind brushing. Would pay for something if necessary, but if i can do it home i will.

Personal Preferences

What size dog are you looking for?
I guess medium-ish to small because realostocally I would live in a small-ish apartment so not a lot of space for a oarge dog.

How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?
Shedding is fine. Barking?? I think the dog would need to be relatively quiet. I do not like slobber but if its minor its ok.

How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?
Ehhh i dont really care. I mean its nice but I can live without that.

Dog Personality and Behavior

Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?
Snuggly preferrably

Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?
Dont actually know

How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?
1) as i would live in a multi story building, preferrably little to no reaction unless someone comes inside, then barking etc is ok. 2) preferrably could pass without having a fucking meltdown

Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?
No

Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?
Aggression in general, afraid of touch

Lifestyle

How often and how long will the dog be left alone?
It would vary depending on the class scheuldw, but I'd say anywhere from 0-6 hours. If I had a long lunch break or free period I would go home to do my work, and on the weekends I tend to stay at home or bring the dog with me wherever i go. Im not the ""lets go out and party"" type at all. Sure there could be a few exceptions, but im talking like once every few months.

What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?
Would live alone

Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?
No

Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?
Not regularly but occasionally

Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?
Yes. I am actually not certain and will look into that

What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?
Finland. No banned breeds. 

What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?
Spring 0-12 celcius, summer 15-30 celcius (it really varies), autumn -5 - 15 celcius, winter just generally below zero even down to -30 occasionally

I asked very specific questions about her behavior, including any tendency toward aggressiveness, possessiveness, etc. The foster assured me the dog was as sweet as can be and has never shown any signs of aggresssion toward people, or other dogs.  

I understand that the dog is in a new environment, and it‚Äôs possible that she will calm down after she‚Äôs adapted, but she is snapping/snarling at my (neutered male) dog every time he attempts to play with her. In other words, her Chow-Chow is showing. I adopted her specifically for my male dog to have a playmate and a companion. She seems to have no interest in his companionship. I feel like I‚Äôve acted irresponsibly by bringing a dog into my home, knowing that Chow-Chow‚Äôs don‚Äôt typically play well with others. I trusted the word of the foster, and gave the dog the benefit of the doubt. I don‚Äôt know what to do about this. Can she learn to get along with others? Even if she learns to be less aggressive, will she want to play with my other dog?  

I can return her to the rescue within 24 hrs of adopting, and I am considering this, but I feel like I‚Äôm giving up on her too soon. I want to give her a fair chance, but not at the risk of my other dog getting hurt, or ending up with a dog he can‚Äôt play with. I‚Äôm really torn as to what I should do.

1200,"Hey everyone! I have a two year old Pomeranian named Finn, who has been in my life for a year and a half. He‚Äôs my best friend, and I spend weekends sometimes spoiling him with dog park visits, dog bakeries, spa days, etc. He‚Äôs extremely social, and he loves playing with other dogs at the park, no problem.

Enter our new family addition, Wepah. He‚Äôs fourteen, and we are determined to give him a new chance outside the shelter. So far, he‚Äôs warming up spectacularly, and he‚Äôs coming right out of that shelter shell. Despite his age, he‚Äôs a great play buddy who gets zoomies the second he realizes its walk time.

We were expecting jealousy from Finn, but he‚Äôs absolutely ignoring Wepah. Wepah will follow Finn like his shadow and try to play in every way he knows (play bows, bounces, everything Finn usually does) but Finn wants nothing to do with him. He pushes him out of the way, ignores his attempts to initiate play, and generally acts out of character. It‚Äôs a little heartbreaking to see the old boy get turned down so much. Is it just jealousy? Will they warm up to each other in time?

For context, we‚Äôve had Wepah for a little over a week. They‚Äôre both about 20 lbs, give or take. Also, I know Wepah is a weird name, lol.

1201,"I don‚Äôt think I can say the name of the place for legal reasons... but its a very well known daycare with a lot of franchises throughout the US. 

Didn't have a problem with my coworkers, they were very nice, but the way the place is run is complete chaos. I know this wasn‚Äôt just the specific location I worked for, I heard horror stories from people that worked at other locations too. In my area and some out of state. 

It was always overbooked. The managers would continue to accept daycare dogs even though every yard was full (we had 4 indoor/outdoor yards for larger dogs and 2 for smaller ones. The max was 25 dogs per yard, and often we‚Äôd come out at 40+) and because of overcrowding fights happened on the daily. 

Aggressive dogs were never turned away because they were the ones that came the most often. I remember there was a boxer that, whenever the gate was opened, would attack any dog that was near him. We could not put dogs in or take them out of the yard unless he was not in there. Every time we had to put a dog in or get someone out we had to stop everything and have one person get him and take him to the back hallway. We had to stop letting dogs out for him because he would also attack dogs that passed by him in the hall, and it was almost impossible to stop him. 
When I asked that they kick him out, the managers blamed it on the fact that the employees don't manage the gate well enough, and the dog is just ""sad and misunderstood"" 

There have been instances where daycare dogs had sat in kennels for hours on end because they couldn't be in the yard with other dogs they have problems with. Their parents pay for full days of daycare ($40/day) and their dog can‚Äôt even go out because they get attacked or they do the attacking and cause all sorts of issues. 

There was another dog, a pit mix named Bentley, who would guard the employees in the yard. If you tried to pet another dog, or if you were petting Bentley and another dog came near, he would attack, like really viciously attack. I was petting this dog named Ruby who wasn‚Äôt very socialized. (she was a foster) She was really wary of people (not aggressive, just really submissive and nervous) so it was a huge deal for me to be touching her and for her to be trying to love on me like she was. At the time no one told me about Bentley‚Äôs guarding situation, so as I was in the moment with Ruby, he came out of nowhere and started snapping at her, and then started going after her and it turned into a fight. My friend was in the yard next to me and he tried to blow his horn (we used air horns to stop fights) because I didn‚Äôt have one (I switched someone out while they were in the bathroom and they took the horn) but it didn‚Äôt work and I ended up grabbing Bentley‚Äôs collar and pulling him out of the yard. They tell you not to do that because the dog can redirect and bite you, but at that point I didn‚Äôt care I just wanted him out. Ruby had to go to the vet with a hole in her ear and a neck puncture. Did they kick out Bentley? No. 

I got in a LOT of trouble for grabbing the collar, and Bentley was just labeled as ‚Äúhaving a bad day‚Äù and Ruby, who was the victim in this situation got called ‚Äútoo high energy to be with a large group‚Äù and was returned to the rescue we were fostering her from. 

They told Bentley‚Äôs parents that he was great at daycare, that no issues happened, and that he was one of the most calm dogs we had. I watched my manager tell this bold faced lie like it was the truth, and the owners simply smiled and said ‚Äúgreat, see you guys tomorrow!‚Äù 

They had so many aggressive dogs. How no one ever got injured or sued is beyond me. 

There was a big shepherd named Jade who was incredibly DA and who would lash out at any dog that touched her. 

A little boxer named T who would bully weaker more timid dogs by barking in their faces and snapping them. In such a crowded space she would start huge fights. 

Max, a little white pit mix who would literally snap and full blown attack out of nowhere. We were trained to read behavior and social cues, and he never showed any. He was incredibly unstable.

Cole the lab, who was grumpy all the time. He would do this high pitched bark for hours, and if another dog approached him he would snap at them. 9/10 times it started a fight. 

Sam the boxer had problems with literally everyone. Balancing the yard with him in it was almost impossible because he attacked most dogs that came in the gate, and eventually he would just find someone he didn‚Äôt like. 

Jack the GSD/lab mix was worse when he first started coming, but he still does this. He would grab the back of the most dominant dog‚Äôa collar and pull while he started humping them. Of course this started a huge fight. 

Just a few of the many examples I witnessed. Were any of these dogs kicked out? Nope. As a matter of fact all of them are still allowed back to this day. The managers are awful people who truly only cared about money, and unfortunately I feel like a lot of places end up being this way.

He came to us as a stray, but I‚Äôm becoming more and more convinced that he was once owned at some point and maybe got abandoned. He understands sit, down (like from furniture), come, stay, go outside, etc... He doesn‚Äôt bark a whole lot, he‚Äôs not aggressive at all, plays well.

1210,"Hi /r/dogs,

We have a 1.5 year old boxer mix, originally adopted from a litter of ~8 at a shelter local to us at age 9 weeks or so. For the first year or so he was great, no anxiety, no problems, we went to all three classes for training offered at our local pet store, etc. Behavior was totally normal, loving dog, etc.

Lately he's been acting really weird. The first thing was when he stopped eating. When we serve him food (at the same location daily), we have him sit first, then give him permission to eat. Usually he would eat like crazy and be done. Lately he eats 3-4 bites then sits next to the bowl and just stares at us. Sometimes it takes 10x times coercing him to eat just to get him to finish his food. This has gone on for 2+ months.

We went to the vet, they wanted to do thousands of dollars of lab work and imaging which we couldn't afford all of, but we did elect to due a variety of blood tests which came back normal. Vet said maybe he's not hungry, try serving less more often, try a different food, etc. We've stopped serving him so much and generally it's been fine, if he doesn't finish then we save it for the next night. Vet also commented on his facial acne, which is normal, but recommended we switch water bowls to stainless steel.

This is where it all goes downhill.. we purchased 2 large auto-fill water bowls and 1 small auto-fill water bowl, and he will not drink out of the large ones. It's like he is scared of it. Even putting a treat literally in the bowl he wont go near it. Either he can't tell there is water in the bowl or he is scared of it.

We're willing to do (within reason) whatever it takes to make sure our pupper is satisfied and free of anxiety.. but we can't figure out what the issue is here. Any suggestions or things to try?","[Help] 1.5 year old boxer mix, scared/timid of food/water bowls, odd behavior generally",dogs

If you play with him he won't play and if you crouch and tell him to come to you after you played, he'll hide and start looking down like you just yelled at him.

Anytime someone knocks he walks away and if there's no tension he'll come sit next in the stairs in front of the door and just watch, however, if that unknown person comes close the my dog he'll let them pet him but without looking at that person directly in the eyes.

Can someone explain me this behavior? If it's trainable or not?

My other dog barks and will gentle bite when I play and always wants to be pet, eats whenever she needs wherever the bowl is.

1224,"I am in need of major help with an issue that I‚Äôve run into with my Shepherd. I purchased him at around 3 months old and there is a big problem I am running into, he is always peeing on himself in his crate! It‚Äôs gotten to the point where i am embarrassed to have anyone over because the ‚Äúdogs room‚Äù smells like pee because it‚Äôs gotten into the wood floors. I work from home and I‚Äôve tried everything I can imagine to fix this issue. 

Here is just a preview of the trial/error I‚Äôve done to resolve this.

- Take him out every hour or so and put him back in his cage to make sure he is relieved

-Place a baby gate in the bathroom and keep him there while I am working. He still pees on the floor. 

- Leave him walking around the house. Didn‚Äôt pee, but jumped on furniture and also tried to get on the counters (broke a glass).

Here‚Äôs the thing.. I‚Äôve been advised it might be something medical, but strange enough if I keep him in a room with me throughout the day or let him sleep with me at night he will not pee on himself and can hold it. Do you think this is separation anxiety? Or does he just associate a cage with the bathroom? Please help. I am running out of options. 

FYI: I can‚Äôt keep him in the room with me while I am working because i am on webcam. If it wasn‚Äôt for this I‚Äôd always keep him in my office with me to avoid the issue.",[help] 1 year old German Shepherd won‚Äôt stop peeing on himself.,dogs
1225,"1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No. I‚Äôve had dogs my whole life. Trained 2 from puppies. 




2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I‚Äôd prefer to rescue.




3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Something small-medium sized with a low maintenance coat.




4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I‚Äôm don‚Äôt care much about breeds, but the types of dogs I‚Äôve had in the last few years are an American Bulldog and a Lab/Pit mix (my moms dogs so I no longer live with them, they‚Äôre the ones I trained from puppies mostly myself) and a Boxer who recently died. He was great but high energy even in his old age and I‚Äôd like something lower energy for my next companion.




5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

The usual; sit, stay, paw, lay down, ‚Äúcome‚Äù, and words like ‚Äústop‚Äù and ‚Äúno‚Äù of course.




**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

As long as it needs, but I would prefer it didn‚Äôt need a crazy amount. No working type dogs for me lol.




7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I have a fenced in backyard so I typically would let my dog out to play for awhile every day either by himself/with me or my boyfriend, or with our friends‚Äô dogs. A 45-1hr long walk every other day and shorter ones daily. 




8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am not open to trimming hair or paying a professional to do so. I prefer a dog I can brush every other day and have it be fine. I clean my own dogs ears and clip their nails. 




**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

I‚Äôve always had big dogs and I‚Äôm interested in a small to medium sized one. 30-40 pounds would be a max. But I am not open to toy breeds whatsoever. 15-25 pounds would be ideal probably.




10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

I can handle a lot of slobber and barking but I don‚Äôt prefer it. I can handle mild to moderate shedding. I can handle more slobber than barking and shedding.




11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not too important. My Boxer could not be off leash in a non fenced area and it bugged me a little.




**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Somewhere in between, but leaning toward snuggly.




13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

In between, again. One that doesn‚Äôt lean too far either way. Leaning toward eager to please. Easier training is never a bad thing of course. 




14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I could do without barking at knocks on the door but don‚Äôt mind a little. I would like my dog to greet strangers warily however it‚Äôs not paramount. 




15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

Mild aggression that goes away with familiarity is ok. I couldn‚Äôt have a dog that aggressive to other dogs period.




16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

No.




**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

As many as 4 hours a day on weekdays but more often only 2 or 3. 




18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

My boyfriend lives with me but has no preferences. He‚Äôll watch the dog when I‚Äôm at work and we share dog duties.




19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have a cat. He‚Äôs outside in the backyard for most of the summer but comes in when it‚Äôs cold or raining. This dog will be mine, but we will probably get another Boxer in a few years. They‚Äôre my boyfriends favorite breed and he wants another but not any time soon. 




20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

Not currently but I can‚Äôt have a child aggressive dog as I‚Äôll definitely have children in the next 10 years.




21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

We own a house.




22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in the U. S. I don‚Äôt believe any breeds are banned. Pits are frowned upon, however I will not be getting a Pit anyway.




23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

I live in New England. It gets pretty cold in the winter and fairly hot in the summer.




**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

My Boxer died recently and I‚Äôve been thinking about my next companion. I‚Äôve never chosen a dog myself (all that I‚Äôve had have been more ‚Äúcan you please take this dog‚Äù situations) and even though I‚Äôve loved them all I would like to be a little more choosey this time around since I don‚Äôt know anyone currently with a dog that needs to be homed immediately. I‚Äôm not strict on which breed and would in fact prefer a mix but am wondering what mixes to look out for?

1233,"What are your best resources to learn about canine body language and preventing leash reactivity?

Background:

A few weeks ago my husky/mal mix was attacked by an ill trained labradoodle on the way to the dog park. Both dogs were leashed but the attacking dog was leering at my dog as he was walking by and then lunged across the sidewalk and attacked and bit his face (there was blood and a scar). I quickly pulled my dog back but for the rest of the night he would ‚Äúhusky growl‚Äù and pull towards any dog we walked past and was generally frustrated. 

It‚Äôs been a few weeks now and he‚Äôs decidedly more leash reactive (he had next to no issues with dogs leashes/unleashed before. Not particularly dominant, more medium in the pack). Sometimes when passing larger dogs he‚Äôll pause and if they stare at him or start to stiffen he‚Äôll lunge towards them and husky growl or make protesting sounds. He‚Äôs a large dog so this can intimidate some dog owners and it‚Äôs really embarrassing!

His growls don‚Äôt sound like they are aggressive but he‚Äôs generally a very silent dog so they‚Äôre jarring even to me and the few times we‚Äôve let them ‚Äúplay it out‚Äù it looked like aggressive dominant play where they would growl and jump on each other without biting but really roughly. We never let these sessions last longer than 10 seconds or so before deescalating and distracting the dogs. After any of these interactions he immediately returns to being well behaved, happy and normal. 

I‚Äôm not sure why this happens with some dogs (sometimes from several feet away!) while 99% of dogs he just meets with aloof disinterest. 

I‚Äôm also not sure when a husky growl turns into a real growl vs play talk/warning because I‚Äôve never seen him bite/snap/etc and his vocalizations usually happen when he‚Äôs trying to get another dog to play.

Any resources to increase my understanding would be really helpful!

1242,"I would be grateful for any advice, perspectives, or discussion any of you are willing to offer!

Long post warning!

My wife and I would like to get a second dog, and want to get a larger breed both from the perspective of just loving dogs in general and large dogs in particular, and from the standpoint of home/family protection.  

Our current situation: We have one dog already who‚Äôs fairly small, she‚Äôs a 5 year old, 14-lb rescue dog terrier mix that gets along great with my kids (2 and 5 years old).  We got our current dog when she was 9 months old and were able to socialize her and train her well, and she is really good natured with kids and other dogs - she only gets pushy if a dog she doesn‚Äôt know is trying to interact with the kids, but is otherwise very laid back in most all situations, is tolerant of rough handling and people messing with her food when she eats, etc.  we ‚Äúkid-proofed‚Äù our pooch as much as possible so she wouldn‚Äôt be afraid if they grabbed her tail, her paws, touched near her eyes, grabbed her ears, poked her flanks while she was eating, and so forth, with great success.  In brief, our current dynamics are healthy and stable between the pet and our kids, and my kids both have grown up with our dog and do a generally decent job of being polite with animals (we are taking great pains to teach our girls to interact with pets well).

My parents have a 10 month old Labrador puppy they‚Äôve have since he was 3 or 4 months (though he is not very well trained yet), and the two of them generally get along well and interact good even if my kids are around - my daughters love both dogs, both are good and act well around the kids, and after my dog got to know the Labrador pooch well she ‚Äútrusts‚Äù him around the girls, and he is very differential to my dog.

We want to be as safe and careful as we can with bringing another dog into the mix, and while we would like to get a larger breed we know that this entails some extra risk and requires a good deal more responsibility on our part to make sure we keep the dynamics healthy, and raise new the new pooch well.  Do any of you have any advice or experiences you‚Äôd care to share?  We are really partial to getting dogs from the animal shelters or local rescue groups (as we did with our current dog, who is just wonderful), but will limit ourselves to getting puppies to make sure we have the most control possible over its attitudes towards people and other animals.

I grew up with large dogs( a German shepherd mix and a Doberman, both were wonderful with me and my brother when we were kids), and have raised two dogs from puppies as an adult (our current dog, and a Labrador).  We did obedience training with everyone, and agility work with the Labrador, and I had a little bit of experience helping a dog trainer and working as a kennel tech when I was younger, so I‚Äôm not new to dogs or dog training, but I want to learn as much as I can.  We also don‚Äôt care at all about breeds and prefer mixed breeds/mutts, but I know the breeds can have a large impact on temperament; if any of you guys have advice about breeds, too, I would be grateful.  The shelters in my area usually have lots of really adorable lab/pit bull mixes, and those are two of my favorite dog breeds, but I‚Äôve never raised a pit bull or a mix and am a little unsure with their reputation for dog-aggressiveness.

More info on us/our thoughts:

We also had a thought to get a male dog in the idea that it would not be competing for the same spot in the pack hierarchy as our current dog or my wife/daughters (I am not concerned with my own ability to insure the pooch knows it place with regard to me).  Our current dog was the dominant female at her rescue/foster home when we got her, and while she never really pushed me she did try to exert her dominance over my wife in small ways for several months.  My wife did a good job of sorting this out, though she did not grow up with dogs and has less experience than me.

We generally do not use negative reinforcement with dog training, as experientially speaking all of the dogs we have trained or raised with mainly positive reinforcement seem to have much better temperaments as adults.

We don‚Äôt use a crate regularly with our current dog, but she is crate trained (she‚Äôll use a crate without complaint, and likes to sleep in a dog bed in a crate like environment whenever she‚Äôs not laying in the bed with us or the kids).  We both work Monday-through Friday, but with staggered hours- our dog is usually by herself for 6 hours a day.

I‚Äôd be grateful for any advice!

1243," 

So my roommate (an older retired guy) runs a dog sitting business out of his house. I want to get some opinions on what dog owners here would think of the quality of service he provides and whether he‚Äôs doing anything wrong or not. I myself would be uncomfortable leaving my dog with him but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being unreasonable or not.

So the service he offers is dog sitting in his home. Doggy daycare basically for day visits and long term stays. He advertises that they are walked during the day and taken on twice daily dog park visits. He presents himself as an authority on dogs at the dog park, and has told people he can work with their dogs as far as training them.

What really happens is this: He sometimes goes to the dog park once a day, rarely twice a day and does not take all the dogs. Most days he doesn‚Äôt go at all. Only the ones he‚Äôs decided he likes the most. The ones left behind are not walked or fed before he leaves. Very rarely do any dogs get walked during the day, and that means they are forced to go potty in the house. This alone would bother me as I would think that would affect their being house trained at home.

He posts photos of himself with the dogs on Facebook that makes it looks like he engages them during the day (he really feeds off of the attention he gets on social media). In reality he sits in his chair all day on Facebook, only interrupted by his daily 2-4hr nap. He yells at the dogs when they are all over him trying to get attention or barking because they want to play or go outside.

He spends a good portion of the day screaming at them from his chair, and as a result a lot of the dogs fear him. He doesn‚Äôt hit or kick them but he doesn‚Äôt interact with them in any way that would make them comfortable except for his few ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù. The ones that fear him make him very angry bc they won‚Äôt obey his commands, they only hide from him.

He took in a cat for a homeless woman while she is looking for a new place to stay, and the cat didn‚Äôt eat at all for 3 days. I told him it‚Äôs very dangerous for cats to go more than a day or two without any food or water and that he should either take her to the vet or at the least call the owner so they could take her if she won‚Äôt eat. He angrily refused to do either as if I had offended him and instead decided to force feed the cat instead (which worked and the cat ate from then on but it didn‚Äôt seem like the right way to handle it to me. I could be wrong though.) That cat lives in his closet now.

He does not work with any dogs to help train them as he claims, and does things that most trainers now say is the opposite of helpful like rubbing their noses in their pee when they potty inside (even though they had no choice bc he won‚Äôt walk them). He has also bought a bark collar for a particularly vocal dog, and talked about buying more but hasn‚Äôt yet.

Some dogs come here on special diets, and he mocks the owners after they leave and feeds the dogs whatever he wants to feed them. He gave chicken to a dog whose owner said she was allergic to it more than once. He sets out a bunch of bowls of food for all the dogs at once, and some dogs end up eating more than one bowl while some of the more timid dogs end up with little to nothing.

He left his weed out once, and a dog ATE IT. He took it to the vet bc it was so lethargic and difficult to awaken. The dog ended up being fine by the next day and he never told the owner. If dogs are hurt or get in fights a lot, but there‚Äôs no visible injury like blood, he won‚Äôt mention anything to the owners at all.

He has a blind dog that he leaves on his bed alone, and he has fallen off before, yet he still puts him up there unsupervised and is angry if the dog doesn‚Äôt want to sleep the whole time it‚Äôs here.

Like I said, he‚Äôs not hitting or kicking or handling them rough, but this all still strikes me as being wrong on some level.

1247,"I am feeling defeated. We got a dog 2 months ago. She's a year old golden mix. My 4 year old is extremely impulsive and hyperactive (he has ADHD, but is not medicated because he's 4). 

He is constantly hitting the dog. He will walk up and punch her, pull her tail, poke her in the eye, mess with her mouth... all the same antagonizing stuff he does to his older siblings. I've tried a million times to give the dog attention and ignore him and then make him show me nice behavior to the dog. He can do that, but quickly reverts back to impulsive and hurting the dog. I reinforce his positive behavior whenever he shows affection, which is often because he does also really love the dog. When he hurts the dog, she never yelps, cries, growls or anything. She just takes it. 

The dog really gets hyper too when he's rough housing with her and she will jump on the couch, mouth/play biting our arms, jump up on people and those are all the behaviors I'm trying to work on her NOT doing and he's encouraging it AND hurting her. They are never left alone together, but I just don't have the time to sit with both of them constantly to monitor behavior.

1254,"Hi! 
I've never really posted here but i'd love to get some insight. 

A little backstory: I live with my parents and sister, we all love animals specially dogs. We had a 7 year old pitbull named Zeus who tragically passed away this past February. I was on vacation when he passed but my parents and sister witnessed everything, it definitely left them traumatized to the point of my sister needing therapy in order to get over her grief. She decided right afterwards that she never wanted to have a dog again and we even made the decision to move to a new house, partly because the old one was where Zeus grew up in and everything reminded us of him. 
My sister is now much much better, she's got a bunny which she takes care of and is slowly growing into the idea of having a dog but definitely doesn't want to take care of it and has mentioned that she would be very cautious in getting emotionally attached to it because she doesn't want to suffer again. I understand that and respect it. 

It was definitely hard on me too, i was his main caregiver and he was with me at all times. I still cry sometimes because i miss him but honestly his health was SO bad before he passed that when he did i was a little relieved that even though he didn't die from illness his body was finally resting. (We never got an official diagnosis as to what made him sick, but he had facial paralysis, lost his eyesight and had two episodes where he became paralyzed from his back legs for weeks...) 

He really was the king of our house and we took really good care of him since he was 12 weeks so it took us by surprise when he got sick... Luckily we could afford the several different treatments, vet visits, therapy and MRIs that he needed.

His final year of life really exhausted me, i loved him with all my heart but i was having to carry around his meds everywhere we went, weekly vet visits and just struggling 24/7 in keeping his quality of life at least ""decent"".

Anyway... I feel like now we could get a new puppy but i'm just so afraid of getting a breed with health issues whether they come from the breed, bad breeding or just bad luck. 

My family and I have talked about it and if i were to get one i would again be the main caregiver, which is perfectly fine with me, i really want to have company again and have someone to cuddle. 

I'm excited and scared!

1255,"I adopted a 3.5 yr old male neutered husky from the shelter. He is a great dog when I'm around. He is well trained, is loving and affectionate, and has brought me a lot of joy. There is another side to him however. When I leave my apartment, even for 20 minutes, he absolutely destroys the place. Initially, he ripped up my carpets and tore half of my wall down the first time I left him alone. So I eventually was forced to close him off in my bathroom to avoid complete destruction of my place. I have tried everything. I tried crate training him. He freaked out to the point where he ripped his gums open and bent the bars on the crate trying to escape. He then ripped up the bottom of the crate and destroyed the floor under it. I tried begging my vet for help. We tried every herbal/aroma/sound therapy that exists. Eventually we decided on medication. The medication helped for a few days and then he went back to the usual destruction even when the dose was upped. I tried myself with benadryl which did absolutely nothing. I tried a kong toy, ropes, tennis balls, every distraction toy you can think of. I tried getting a camera that I can speak through to sooth him. I tried borrowing my girlfriends dog and seeing if another dog would help. I tried jogging and running with him before leaving him to tire him out. I tried food to distract him. I have literally scoured the internet and my vets knowledge and tried everything humanly possible. I have spent thousands of dollars on medications, cages, toys, ect. I have spent over $500 in repairs and after today will likely double that.

What‚Äôs worse is one of the guys punched one of the barking pups to try and shut them up (I ended up calling animal control on them after I got home and I really hope the pups were taken away because they do not deserve that kinda shit)

1266,"Pets gain more and more ground in our hearts and homes! However, obligations and everyday life, often, do not allow us to offer what we would like to our little friends, whose needs for interaction and socialization are high.

&amp;#x200B;

Dogs are social and need daily exercise and the services of a dog walker can offer that. Many dog walkers often offer dog care as a complimentary service, which your pet will also appreciate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things to consider:**

Your dog is trained to have you as the leader of the team. If you are going to hire a dog walker, it is important to meet all together at least a few times to get the dog accustomed to the dog walker. It is important to get to know the dog walker and trust him, both you and your pet.

&amp;#x200B;

On first encounters, give the dog walker the opportunity to lead your dog. If your dog is trained, there should be no problem. If, however, your dog is excited, observe how your dog walker handles your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

Inform the dog walker regarding the needs of your dog. Be clear about nutrition, handling and any equipment he may need. Correspondingly, the dog walker has to inform you about the course of the walk, as well as the number of dogs he walks altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

Questions concerning the walker's experience are also important, so don't' skip them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pet Cost and Pet Care:**

It is quite common for the cost to change according to the requirements of the service, depending on how often the dog walker is needed within the week, as well as the duration of the walk. The safest solution is to search in your area for dog walkers and compare the prices and services offered. Some people play games with animals, run with them, etc. Other services include grooming, food, and snacks.

&amp;#x200B;

It is important to see if the dog walker can offer your dog the ride you desire, with the methods you choose, which he/she knows to apply.

&amp;#x200B;

**If you have a pet:**

Dog walking is a service for those pets that their owners can not provide them with the socialization and exercise they need. A walk with a dog walker does not, in any case, replace the care of the owner. A dog walker should be seen as an interim solution rather than a convenience for the owner.

&amp;#x200B;

Discover the dog walkers in your area and ask about their services. Walking or keeping the dog should be done by people who have personal or professional experience with dogs and the desire to learn more about our small friends and their proper care. But the most important thing is, whoever you choose to walk your beloved dog, to trust them and see your animal happy with them.

&amp;#x200B;

A good dog walker should relieve you and not make you worry about the safety of your pet. Take time until you trust the dog walker and you will find that he can be a significant support to your dog's happiness!",[Discussion] Dog Walker,dogs
1267,"I adopted a dog from a very high kill shelter about a month ago. Had an interview, told them exactly what I was looking for. I told them that I would be gone 8-9 hours a day, needed a dog that I could crate train, a dog that very non aggressive to both humans and dogs since I frequently visit family with dogs, and would prefer a dog good with children since I'm around children all the time and I never know if one of my students will run up to me if I'm at a park or something. They showed me a dog that they said fit all criteria. I spent a few hours with him at the shelter, then took him home. To shorten in, I tried to keep him for a week. He was extremely male aggressive, dog aggressive, and kid aggressive. Even with proper introductions. Would lunge at everything, wasn't house trained, and wouldn't even go inside the crate to eat high value treats. I couldn't leave him alone and I couldn't take time off work, so I had to return him this time with SPECIFIC information about him so he could find a good fit. I told them an adult female only house would be great for him, and that he did have good qualities and definitely wasn't always a stray and had training.

I took a few weeks break and decided to go to a rescue instead of a shelter. Told them the same information, my work hours, my energy expectations. They matched me with what they said was a Shepard/collie mix. Well everyone else who saw him after I took him home said he was for sure actually a husky/lab mix. It showed in his behavior. I tested out his anxiety when I was gone and he did okay. Scratched my door to hell, but that's manageable and I bought a door guard. Then I got a text message at work about my dog being outside. He had chewed through several layers of hardwood to escape the house. He also had crate reactivity (would panic just at the sight of it). I gave it a few days, took him to my parents, tried to find a daycare that would work, and there was nothing. He didn't have separation anxiety (was fine with me gone if he was outside, or if I was in the bathroom, or if he was in one room and I was in another), he just always wanted to escape wherever he was. I gave him back to the rescue and made sure they knew about his issues and also his positives. I loved that dog even with his issues, and I can't stop crying about it. He was an amazing dog, but I couldn't give him what he needs. He needed a household with at least 1 dog, a yard to run in, and he couldn't be left in a house alone. I made that clear in a letter I wrote to the rescue.

I want to adopt another dog but I don't know if I can, I know at the least I'll be waiting awhile. I know shelter dogs will have problems, but there are some I'm not equip to deal with and I've been clear about those. I don't mind accidents in the house, or pulling on leashes, or high energy, or low energy, or scratching doors. I am not willing to deal with dog and human aggression, and I do not have the lifestyle to work around extreme separation anxiety or the need to escape. I'm also having a hard time trusting shelters now. I know they can't always predict behavior, but surely there were warning signs before.

1268,"[Help] 
I have a 9 month black lab mix. I rescued him from a shelter in Ohio at the end of July. Then three weeks later moved to Baltimore for grad school. My work schedule requires me to be away for about 7 hours, then I come home to let him out/play for about 45 minutes before going to class for another 3 hours (this is Monday/Wednesday, Tuesday/Thursday/Friday I‚Äôm gone but not quite as long). 

At the beginning of September, I didn‚Äôt have a job and would come home every 2-3 hours to let him out (between classes). However I realized I can‚Äôt do this forever because after grad school, I‚Äôll probably be working longer hours. So to avoid coddling him, I‚Äôve been leaving him at home for longer periods of time. Well, it turns out he was barking the entire entire I was gone. It‚Äôs not terrible, but I‚Äôm sure it annoys the neighbors and my roommates. So I‚Äôve started giving him a Kong filled with his food and topped off with peanut butter before I leave in the morning. I‚Äôve been told he hasn‚Äôt been barking as much, so it‚Äôs working! My original thought was to distract him long enough that he didn‚Äôt wake any one up, so for limited barking or whining I‚Äôm ecstatic!

I‚Äôve done some research to figure out if he‚Äôs having more separation anxiety or something else. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs more of confinement or isolation anxiety. Originally, he would start panicking when put in his crate but the Kong and time has helped him get over that. But if he‚Äôs put in a room when other people are home, he pretty much goes crazy. He‚Äôs fine if he can be by the person (it doesn‚Äôt even have to be me), but freaking out if there‚Äôs something keeping him away. 

My current struggle is the crate time. When I‚Äôm gone, I keep in his crate (it‚Äôs big enough for him). I‚Äôve tried leaving him out in just my bedroom, but it doesn‚Äôt work very well. He‚Äôs fine if he‚Äôs sleeping when I leave, but if he‚Äôs not he destroys my door and carpet. Not for bathroom issues but trying to get out of the room. If I leave him out, whether in my room or the house, he goes into the puppy/adventurous phase of getting into the trash and chewing up blankets. That‚Äôs pretty typical stuff that he will grow out of eventually, so I‚Äôm not super concerned. But I‚Äôm worried about him destroying the house further or getting my roommates stuff. My personal items, I keep up to avoid damage but the items in the common areas I don‚Äôt have as much control over. He hasn‚Äôt destroyed anything too expensive (yet), but I don‚Äôt want to risk it. 

Anyhow, it‚Äôs come down to I need to keep him in my room (at the minimum) when I‚Äôm gone. My question is, how do I help him get over his isolation/confinement issues so he‚Äôs not destroying my door? I hate having to keep him in his crate all day, but it seems like the only option so he isn‚Äôt destroying stuff. 

I don‚Äôt want to rely on my roommates letting him out. It isn‚Äôt fair to them to expect that, though I definitely don‚Äôt say no if they offer. I‚Äôm also on a student budget, and preparing for future life, so I can use a dog walking service if needed but that‚Äôll be more of a last resort for me.

I have a 16 month old westiepoo. I adopted him about six months ago after losing my hospice gal that was about 17, and he is the light of my life. He is the sweetest, smartest dog I have know. He is 15 pounds, but when I say he has the energy of a German shepherd I wish I was exaggerating. We also have a cat, and the amount of times he has tried to get the cat are just too many to count by now.

He has always been a reactive dog, and I have worked with a trainer pretty much since week 1. He is smart, he picks up commands like no other dog. But he also is a little bit of a selective listener... I think he just gets to a stage of hyper-focus and when he gets there, it's hard to bring him down. For the past three months the situation just escalated with the cat and he has actually hurt the cat a couple times. I take all the precautions, I keep them separate, I never leave the dog unattended. He is crate trained... Everything. When the situation started escalating, we added a behaviorist that also has been working with us and the trainer, and some things did help. 

He goes to doggy daycare while I am at work so he can get all the exercise he needs. 

About a month ago, my husband sort of hit a wall, and started talking about rehoming. It broke me, and it broke my heart so hard, I can't even explain how much it hurts. But at this point, we have a trainer, a behaviorist, a veterinarian behaviorist... he has had tests, I am on his training pretty much every minute I can when we are together. He has to work for his food, work for his toys, he eats from puzzles, we go to the park on the weekends, we take REALLY long walks, always to try and keep him tired and in check. It's become exhausting. And it's become so expensive, I can't even think of all the debt I am in and my husband doesn't even know of, because I am afraid of telling him. So many times, the situation has put my marriage at risk, because husband is stressed, and worried about the cat and about me. I have health issues, and already have a lot of trouble sleeping, and still I have been waking up every day at 5:30 and going to sleep past 11 to keep up with his training. 

I am at a point now, that I really don't know if I am the family for him. It feels like he needs to be with people that are with him more than I can be, and people who possibly have another dog (since he does very well when he has a dog friend) but don't have a cat. My money is gone, and my health is going next. It kills me to think of losing my baby, but how much help can I be once my health escalates and I am stuck in bed or the hospital for weeks? 

A few people have been very understanding. Other people just keep implying I am not trying hard enough, and I tend to listen to those more than the others. I keep feeling like I am the worst dog mom out there, like I will never deserve another dog in my life, and how much I am letting my sweet baby down. 

We are meeting a couple on Sunday, and I tried so much to not like them... but I talked to them on the phone yesterday, and they seem so good! They have another dog a tad bit bigger than my baby, they work from home, they have a fenced yard, their lives pretty much revolve around their dog. They have training experience, they have had lots of dogs before, and they said they will do whatever it takes to make me feel better if they do choose to adopt him. 

But I hate myself for having to do it, and the more I hear people imply that there is more to try, and that I have to keep trying and all that, the more it kills me. I read a lot of happy rehoming stories, but I guess I am posting here in hopes of getting a little bit of support, and maybe hearing that I am not that terrible of a person, because it has been really hard to shove that in my mind. 

Please don't shame me, don't be mean... I really just need a little support. ","[help][vent] We are rehoming our dog after so much effort to work with him, and people's judgment makes it so much worse",dogs

1274,"Hello, I have a four year old border collie who has had two of his back molars removed (one a couple years ago, the other a month ago). The vet said the cause was likely the nylabones my dog loved to chew, so I‚Äôve thrown all of those out and don‚Äôt buy him any more hard chew toys. 

The vet gave instructions to begin serving him wet food (either canned or dry food with water added). This is kind of where the trouble started, he wouldn‚Äôt touch the dry food with water added, feeding him canned food alone upset his stomach, so I‚Äôve settled on a mix of canned food and dry food.

1276,"So I‚Äôm a junior in college and my only experience with dogs is working at a daycare. I‚Äôve seen plenty of aggressive dogs and fights, but nothing really compared to this. 

My friend invited me over to hang out at her place. One of her roommates has a pit bull, and from what I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs a good dog, just has a lot of energy. 

What I didn‚Äôt know and wasn‚Äôt warned at all about is that she‚Äôs I guess really really protective of the house. My friend said her roommate usually keeps her in her crate when they have company so I didn‚Äôt think she would be an issue. I was told the worst she does is ‚Äúoh she‚Äôll bark a little at you but she‚Äôs friendly‚Äù 
Now I don‚Äôt mind barking, but when I knocked on the door it was WAY more than ‚Äúa little barking‚Äù

This dog was legit screaming. I heard her run down the stairs and she was growling and snarling like she was attacking something behind the door. For a second I was worried she was attacking my friend. It was one of the roommates and my friend‚Äôs boyfriend that were downstairs trying to distract the dog and get her away from the door so they could let me in. 
It was about 5-8 minutes before they opened the door. When I came in my friend‚Äôs boyfriend just told me to hurry upstairs and I saw the roommate holding the dog back by her collar, and the dog was lunging at me snapping, growling and barking trying to attack me. (I feel like its worth mentioning that my friend‚Äôs roommate is a very fit, in shape woman and she was having a hard time restraining this dog) It was terrifying- what if someone came into the house without knowing she was there?? Which is a very real possibility- they have guests over frequently. After we were in the room the girl released the dog and I heard her run up the stairs and start barking/growling at my friend‚Äôs door. 

I‚Äôm worried because I believe their dog is dangerous and nothing is being done about her behavior. I don‚Äôt know the girl who owns the dog very well but from what I hear she is never home to care for her and doesn‚Äôt put much effort into her training. The girl that was restraining the dog I think does most of the work, or tries to. I imagine that there isn‚Äôt much she can do because the dog isn‚Äôt hers. She profusely apologized to me after she put the dog back in the crate and I don‚Äôt blame her. I feel a little bad for the dog though, and I‚Äôm a little mad at the owner.

One of the guys that lives near them was complaining about them too- he said he was walking his dog and the pit bull slipped its collar and tried to approach his dog, who I guess wasn‚Äôt dog friendly and they got into a scuffle. Thankfully neither dog was injured, but it still pissed the guy off. Then with guests frequently entering their house when the dog is loose... I feel like someone‚Äôs going to get hurt soon. 

I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs anything I can do? I feel like calling the police would be a little much... but maybe animal control? If the girl had not been there the dog would have definitely attacked me... I just don‚Äôt want that to happen to anyone. Maybe its none of my business...

1278,"So I‚Äôm not technically a first time owner, my family has had a chihuahua mix at home for the last few years but I‚Äôm getting ready to move to my own place and am interested in getting a dog to keep me company. So this would be the first time I own a dog completely on my own. 

The hard part in deciding is that I am more of a big dog person (love Dutch shepherds, German shepherds, pit bulls, labs, etc. Favorite dog is probably Australian cattle dog) but will be living in an apartment.  Also most of these breeds are restricted in most apartments. 

As far as my activity levels; I consider myself a fairly active person, but not as much in a way that the dog would be able to participate. I take part in a few organized sports leagues, which I wouldn‚Äôt really be able to bring the dog to. Other than that my girlfriend and I like to go hiking sometimes on the weekends, when the weather permits, which I would love to bring a dog with us . Other than being at work, sports, hanging with friends/girlfriend, I do like to just hangout at home, so I would be able to walke the dog once or possibly even twice a day and be down for hanging out on the couch with him/her. 

Factoring in all of these things, it seems that a Great Dane would be a good choice. I‚Äôve read that even though they‚Äôre big they don‚Äôt need much room, they like to sit around as long as they get to stretch their legs everyday. However I‚Äôve also read they do not have a long life expectancy and can run into some health problems, which might be difficult to handle with my inexperience as an independent owner.   But I‚Äôm still very interested because from all of the information I‚Äôve seen about the breed, it seems that our personality types would be very compatible.  (Plus I love the idea of a 120 lb lap dog)

Based on all of this information, Does anyone have any recommendations of breeds to look into? I‚Äôm open to all sizes of breeds, but really have my heart set on something medium-large sized.

He‚Äôs sleeping about 2-3 hours per night instead of 12+. We took him to the vet today and she said that it‚Äôs probably because of the mass and he‚Äôs most likely in a lot of pain.

1282,"My dog has had an occasional issue over the last couple of years. She‚Äôs about 6, a little overweight, and has Addison‚Äôs disease. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs related to that, since she did it sometimes before the diagnosis and I believe onset. She gets a monthly Percorten V injection and has 1.25 mg of prednisone every other day as a treatment for her Addisons. 

The issue is this: we‚Äôll all be sitting around, watching or laying in bed and she‚Äôll suddenly start making swallowing motions. She‚Äôll look a little concerned and start licking things. Everything. She‚Äôll lick the couches, floor, chairs, the air, me, and anything she can think of. At this point I‚Äôll take her out and she‚Äôll eat leaves and grass for 10 minutes and then she‚Äôll calm down and be fine. Usually she‚Äôll later throw up and get rid of the leaves. 

On occasion, this will happen in the middle of the night and I‚Äôll miss the licking but hear her whimpering at the door to be taken out. 

Sometimes it will seem to begin by her licking and gnawing at herself, but that is not typical. 

I can‚Äôt tell if it begins by her accidentally getting something in her mouth (maybe a bit of dog hair) and then licking things and gathering more dog hair until she‚Äôs fully freaked out. I lean on this theory because she‚Äôll sometime throw up a small pile of hair. These situations usually occur several times over the course of several weeks every few nights and the hair puking usually is near the beginning.

1285,"So a little backstory. We had been looking for a puppy for quite a while, but either the ones we were interested were extremely expensive, or they were female and small (we were looking for a male, medium to large size). We didn‚Äôt want to get one until we knew it was perfect. This may sound selfish, but it‚Äôs the way it happened.

About a week or so ago, we found someone in our area who had some mutt puppies. Absolutely the cutest things ever. Here are some pics of the one we ended up getting. https://imgur.com/gallery/kmzt3i5

Anyway, these puppies were only 3 weeks old at the time, still living off of mommas milk. They weren‚Äôt supposed to be ready until at least 2 months, when they were eating solid food and drinking water independently.

I get a text this morning saying that the puppies are ready and that if I don‚Äôt get mine now, it would be given to someone else. Oh jeez. I haven‚Äôt gotten the kennel yet. No food. Not enough research. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the little guy until another month from now. After hurriedly running all over the world to get him everything he‚Äôd need to not die in my care, I picked him up.

So I need a little help. Not really sure what I‚Äôm doing, but am absolutely determined to learn.

How often do I feed him? I usually work 6am-2pm or 7am-3pm if I‚Äôm not closing. When I close, I go in at 5 and don‚Äôt get off until around 2 in the morning. What‚Äôs a good feeding schedule to fall into?

What‚Äôs the best way to go about potty training? I can handle his indoor pottying for now, but he‚Äôll definitely need to learn sooner rather than later. I‚Äôve only ever potty trained older dogs, and they‚Äôve always seemed to catch on pretty quick.

He smells. Bad. Like he got sprayed by a skunk. But he‚Äôs literally so little I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd bathe him. I don‚Äôt want to emotionally scar him, but this smell has got to go!

He keeps waking up from naps in a jolt, often yipping or whimpering. I‚Äôm afraid he may be having nightmares. Any help?


I‚Äôd also appreciate any extra advice anybody could give. The more the better. Well be taking him to a vet ASAP for a checkup and his vaccinations.

What do you expect when you walk into someone‚Äôs house and the dog is barking at you and you don‚Äôt leave? He warned him and finally resorted to biting. It could have been a lot worse if he wants to do damage - instead he just nipped. 

I feel like if someone is coming to the house they should give me fair warning, not tell me the night before.

1293,"So, we recently adopted an older shelter dog. Darling is a pit/lab mix and they estimated she is about 7 years old. She's very mellow and has fit in perfectly with our family. 

Here is my issue. When we got Darling from the shelter they told us she had some hip problems,  and at one point during her 8 month stay had a small cough. They also gave me a print out of all meds she had been given during her stay. 

We took her to the vet (did the free initial visit at Banfield. Horrible, I know,but we were broke). The doctor noticed that she had been given a monthly dose of ivermectin and said ""oh, so she has demodex "". I told him I didnt think so because I was confident that the shelter would have mentioned if she had demodex and she didn't have any skin issues, at that point. 

Well, now we are three months out and I am starting to think that she may have demodex... We have been using benzoyl peroxide shampoo on her. She also takes cetrizine/ benadryl for itching. 

Here is what I'm stuck on: Did the shelter set me up to have to start over treating the demodex? You have to treat for six months after the last signs of the illness and the treatment is  expensive.  Are there other reasons to administer ivermectin, monthly,  for 8 months?

1299,"My 8 month old American bulldog mystery mix (what the shelter told us she was, we're getting her tested, you can see pics of her from my post history) is a sweet and energetic pup. We live in a metropolitan area with a high percentage of dog ownership and frequently take her to dog parks in the area. She is just over 30 pounds and not growing, so she's a fairly small dog and loves to wrestle with other dogs.

Twice in the past month she's been attacked, once by what appeared to be a black lab, another a German Shepherd mix. Both times she had been at the dog park and she had been minding her own business and both dogs had been showing aggression to other dogs when they pursued her, pinned her down, and started hurting her. Both times the dog had to be removed by the owner, and while my dog had tried to defend herself, she was the only one with wounds (long cuts and deep puncture wounds). She has never left any marks on other dogs, but frequently gets cuts from other dogs.

In our building are several untrained dogs that have gone after her or barked at her for no reason other than being close. Last night, while playing in the park with some dogs she knew, a pug ran up to her growling and snapping at her. She bit him in response and the owner started hitting her while I got her off. My dog showed visible signs where she had been bitten, but the pug was merely red where mine had bit him. I understand the owner being worried about her dog, but hers had been visibly aggressive with other dogs before running up mine.

Lastly, multiple people in my building have either mentioned the event to me or I overheard them telling someone how my dog, ""isn't nice,"" which really upsets me because she has never been mean to a person and has only defended herself when attacked by other dogs. She's sweet and plays so well until an untrained dog comes and starts to hurt her.

I'm just asking for advice on how to help curb my dog's stand her ground response when untrained dogs decide they want to attack, as well as how to deal with breed bias when it is dogs not in the pitbull family that are attacking her, yet people see her own defense as ""aggressive behavior.""

To give additional context, we have been to obedience classes, work very hard on all areas of training, and shows visible signs of learning despite being in her ""teenage"" months. We also learned after adopting her and before she was taken in by the shelter that she had been separated from her mother in animal control because her mother kept attacking her.

Apologies for the long read, we just are looking for good advice for a sweet pup that really is not aggressive, but will stand her ground when threatened. I understand we need to train our dog for all situations, so I was hoping for insight on helping to safely socialize a dog that's been attacked so many times, especially in an environment where so many dogs that aren't judged as harshly act out without responses other than, ""oh, they're just crazy like that!""

tldr: My pup is a tiny AmBulldog mix that keeps getting attacked, but when she defends herself, people assume she's the problem when in most cases she's minding her own business when another dog runs up and hurts her.

Edit: Just wanted to clarify since it has come up a bit in the comments. All of this has occurred within the last two weeks and we have not been back to the park where she was attacked twice. These ARE NOT events that have been ongoing for long amounts of time, we do not return to these places. Last night was in a park with owners we knew better and trusted more. Every instance she has been attacked she has either been playing with other dogs or walking/running by herself in an enclosed and supervised area.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Companion, loyal, will listen/learn commands, low-ish energy. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* Based on my research of my current situation, Basset Hound and Portuguese Water Dog. There are local breeders for these dogs and from what I gather they adapt well to apartment living and have minimal shedding. Plus meet the size requirements of my strata.

* I'd be willing to pay a professional and do the daily/weekly requirements. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* small/medium

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* Minimal. Slobber is ok. Really not a fan of shedding but understand that's a part of the package. Live in an apartment so barking is not really ok. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Medium importance

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* No preference. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Do it's own thing.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Canada, no laws where I live. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Can get above 30 celcius in summer and winter is usually maxed out around -10 celcius but can get colder. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* My biggest worry is I live alone in a one bedroom apartment and I would feel bad having my dog home alone during the day. Also raising a puppy in this environment sounds like it would be brutal for the first 6+ months. Hypoallergenic would be an ideal situation for me. Besides the Basset and PWD, I would think a poodle mix of some sort might fit well.

1302,"Hello! I have a four and a half month old German Shepherd.  She does not care at all when it‚Äôs raining outside. She will get soaked, walk around, sit in mud, and not care at all about the water.

However, when I try to give her a bath (only twice so far because of poop related incidents)  she howls like I‚Äôm tearing off her limbs. I make sure the water is warm but not hot, I‚Äôve tried having no water in the tub and having it filled with like 6 inches of water, I‚Äôve tried standing in the tub with her, having her on a leash, basically holding her in place. I‚Äôve had help during the bath too as it is definitely a two person job. Today we tried the peanut butter trick but she only licked it twice then had no interest. I‚Äôve also tried being soothing with my words and being stern. 

It breaks my heart to hear her howl like that as though I‚Äôm causing her pain. She‚Äôs little enough for now that I can handle her but she‚Äôs growing fast and I need a way to have bath time be calmer for her as I don‚Äôt want a stinky pup.

I'd want to adopt one from a shelter.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

Not that messy, able to live in a smaller space.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I definitely want to know all the breeds that I could look into, but I always wanted a big dog. If that's not manageable I don't mind.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

Just normal commands, able to behave around friends and family.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

This is where it gets difficult. I just moved to a new state a month ago for a job and I am definitely feeling the lack of friends. I would love to devote my time to a dog! I go to the gym at 530 AM then head to work and get back home at either 6pm or 730pm (depending on if I drive or take the bus). Then I spend the rest of my night cooking, preparing for the next day, or playing games. I figure gaming all the time is just not productive, and getting a dog would encourage going outside and being more proactive in the community as well.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

There is a park nearby where all dog owners take their dogs. I can always come back in the morning from the gym and exercise with my dog before heading to work. Evenings can be spent exercising as well.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I don't mind grooming at home, I don't mind paying a professional.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Medium to large!

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Maybe not too much of either, but I don't really mind. Messes are made to be cleaned anyway. I try to keep a tidy apartment, and with small sq footage it's not hard to clean once a week/month.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

Not important, I live in an apartment complex with a 400 sqft studio.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Attentive, snuggly.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Do its own thing.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

If my dog was more calm. I feel like I would focus on training it to react to how I would react to the person. Friend = good, burglar = bad.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

I don't think so, no.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

I'd like to avoid drooling, but I'd love to hear all the options. :)

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

this is something I'm unsure about, definitely on the upwards range of half the day at the moment. I leave my house at 530AM and don't come back until 6 or 730 PM. I would make the adjustment to spending mornings with it, but I'd still be working at 9-5.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone.

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

N/A

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

Not sure about the breed restrictions, but any size is fine.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

While carrying the toy, she'll pace the room, occasionally whine, and she will also dig at blankets like she's nesting. When we took the toy away, she searched for it for several minutes before eventually laying down. Zoey has also been staying incredibly close to my wife and I.

1314,"Last night my dog vomited about 6 times. The vomit was clear, kind of looked like water. He has no energy right now and all he is doing is laying down. The vet gave us anti-vomiting medication and this other medication for upset stomachs. We took him into the vet again and they said that they might have to do an x-ray on him. Does this mean he has intestinal blockage? He hasn‚Äôt eaten, but he drinks a lot of water. ",[HELP] Intestinal blockage?,dogs
1315,"Despite its structure, this story is very true.

The boy first saw the dog on his grandmother‚Äôs porch. He was mostly black except for the grey hairless patch on the top of his back, where it looked as if someone might have doused him with boiling water or grease.  The big black dog had the longest legs any local person had ever seen.  The father guessed and opined that he might have been some sort of lanky Lab or oddly-proportioned mutt.  But the boy knew he was partly or mostly greyhound; he had seen the picture in a book.  The boy knew each breed, its characteristics and its history. Even though he knew, he also knew better than to question the father‚Äôs opinion. 


 The boy couldn‚Äôt understand why such a fine dog would show up on the sagging porch of the tiny dilapidated house on a rural hilltop.  The boy imagined that he had run away from the residence of some rich man, a man with an inside bathroom.  For whatever reason, the dog always looked south down the red-dirt road. The grandmother said it had come from that direction. The boy assumed he was looking back toward the home he had left, or perhaps the hardships he had endured on his migration. 


The father took to calling the dog Amos, after the television character from the 1950s. The boy didn‚Äôt know about the show till he found an article in his Funk and Wagnall Encyclopedia. The boy vowed to see the show, and to understand why it made some people angry, but he never did.


 Amos was skittish and cowed and would only let the boy or the boy‚Äôs cousin touch him.  Amos would approach slowly, allowing the boy to touch his nose, and then his ears, and finally to scratch his back.  As soon as the scratching ended, Amos slunk away and went back to watching the road.  Even when he was being fed a pawn of cold cornbread soaked in bacon grease, he was careful, often taking the prize back to his spot overlooking the road before eating.


Amos could run, as any creature so proportioned should, but his speed, and endurance, seemed to be exceptional, even for his frame.  The boy discovered this as he and his cousin rode in the back of the father‚Äôs truck up the dirt road.  The boy strained his eyes at the sable figure following in the billowing dust.  Even as the truck accelerated to a speed which would have out-distanced a normal dog, Amos kept his pace. Even as the truck crossed the creek and made its way up the giant hill on the distant Hollis road, Amos never faltered. When they returned, the boy would take his handkerchief and wipe the caked red dirt from Amos‚Äô eyes, nose, and mouth.  The father found this funny and chided the boy for his foolishness.


If the family went north up he narrow path, Amos would always pursue the truck, or even run along beside it, but only if the truck went north.  When they left the grandmother‚Äôs house to return home, Amos would watch from his usual spot, but he never followed, as if he could never retrace, or relive, his original journey. 


One early fall Saturday, the boy and his cousin sat beneath the large Poplar in the Grandmother‚Äôs yard when Amos leaped past them and started barking at something in the tall grass next to where they played. When he stood, the boy could see the rattlesnake and hear its awesome whir. The snake struck and hit Amos on the bridge of his nose. Amos grabbed the snake somewhere near its tail and began shaking it violently, its body making a snapping sound like the cracking of a whip.  Amos placed his front paws on the serpent and began to pull it apart before finally letting go. The boy used his Case pocket knife to remove the rattles, eleven and a button. He wrapped the rattles in his handkerchief and put them in his pocket.


Within minutes, the dog‚Äôs nose began to swell and by dark his face looked as if it might split, and he labored to breathe through his mouth. The boy feared Amos would die in the night, but the grandmother melted lard in a black skillet and the father poured it in a Coke bottle and forced it down his throat.  Amos began vomiting almost immediately and then curled up on the sagging porch and slept.  When the boy woke Sunday morning, Amos was sitting in his usual spot looking down the road, his swelling almost gone and his breathing normal.

Boys and girls soon grow too old to ride in truck beds, and Amos soon had no one to pursue. But he still ran, alone, up the old road, the boy watching and marveling as he sprinted up the hill, turned the corner and went out of sight.  In a few minutes Amos would return on his own track, his feet rousing the red dust to life.  


But one day, Amos rounded the corner and didn‚Äôt return.  The boy called for the father and the two left in the truck.  


Somehow the boy presage what had happened. Amos had rounded the corner and ran head-on into a car, a green Plymouth Fury, headed south.  When the father and the boy arrived, a young man and woman were standing over Amos who lay crumpled in a ditch. The Father cursed and threatened the couple for their carelessness, though the boy knew they had done no wrong.  As they drove away, the father took his handkerchief and cleaned the foamy blood from the dog‚Äôs nose, his back broken, his hips turned topsy-turvy. They father said something about being a man and not letting any creature suffer, but the boy was unclear about the words. The father took his revolver from it holster, pointed its barrel between the runner‚Äôs eyes and pulled the trigger.  


Later that evening, the father and the boy buried Amos in his favorite spot.

1317,"When a very skippy, frolicking dog approaches my dog, she is fine with sniffing noses and butts, but when they invite her to play in their clumsy, crazy ways, she usually first gets back and if they don't take the hint, she gives warning snaps (never bites, never pursues a fight, just clearly says ""back off""). She's a small dog and she's been taken from the street when she was already two years old, so it's hard to tell what she's been through. She does not only warn larger dogs that way. Today she scolded a beagle puppy in a similar fashion after he repeatedly jumped on her. So it's not only that she's scared of being stomped. She is a calm dog and clearly just doesn't like that sort of fooling around.

On one hand I'm thinking that as long as she's not agressive she's welcome to have a preference when it comes to the way she wants to play and dogs are free to give each other such warnings in a civil manner.

On the other hand I'm kinda sad that it decreases the amount of her potential friends in the area. It also makes me wonder if I'll be able to visit a dog park or any other place of the sort.

1321,"Hello all! I‚Äôve decided that now is a good time in my life to start thinking about getting a dog. I‚Äôve ‚Äòowned‚Äô 2 dogs previously - they were family dogs and I have moved out since. Been living on my own for 3 years and I am settled enough now to consider a dog of my own.

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* I have owned a rescue Springer Spaniel which includes retraining a few bad habits, but nothing major. And I have owned a Cavalier King Charles, from a puppy which included very basic training.

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* No preference - but would prefer a puppy or younger dog.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* He/she would love their walks and enjoy being trained, but also happy to chill out in the evenings after their final walk. Loyal, friendly, a true companion.

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I‚Äôve always been interested in German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers for their size and nature, but I‚Äôm aware that my current living situation may not be suited for these so I am open to any other breeds if they fit.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* All the basics and more. I would take great time and pleasure in training my dog.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* Medium. But would take small, medium or large if the breed is right.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* Very important, as walks will be on the beach and woodlands.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Ideally a dog that would like a cuddle from time to time, but not overly clingy.

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

* Wants to do its own thing.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* I would prefer the dog to be friendly to visitors and strangers, and not overly responsive to a knock on the door.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* No.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

* Just aggression and excessive barking.

Our habit has become that when I get into the shower in the morning, Remy wants to go play and use the bathroom in the backyard. Sounds great. She gets more exercise than she otherwise would on the morning walk, and she gets another chance at the squirrel that lives back there.

1337,"Hi, thank you for being here. I have been contemplating about re-homing my dog for a while now, but my family and friends have been encouraging me to keep him or reminding how sad it'd be (many many times). Of course I love him, but I have not been as positive and with a strong mentality with this situation that I used to have a year ago. I feel that he could have the chance to be with a better family that suits his lifestyle and needs. I'm pretty conflicted and stressed, and I've cried many times just thinking about it, so I apologize in advance if my post is too long.

Background: I have an almost 3 year old (in January) neutered male Akita at 74 pounds who I got when he was 5 months in 2016. When I first got him, I lived with just my mom and grandma. We had the house, the yard, and the time to care for him together; And I needed the emotional support finishing nursing school, etc. I've brought him for dog training since he was 6 months and completed them. My dog listens to me completely but is stubborn with everyone else when I'm not around. Unexpectedly, my niece (5) and nephews (2 and 3) started living with us a couple months after I got him due to some family issues. That's when plans/priorities all changed and now family situations that have been crazier to deal with (+legal issues). Now, I am looking to move out (suburban to urban) and may be moving across country entirely due to looking for new work and just stress from being home. 

\*He was socialized with dogs and people when he was younger. So it's not like he'll go attack anyone randomly or not listen to commands, etc. He loves the attention, playing, just being next to you and is overall a wonderful fluff ball. These are just certain scenarios I keep thinking of that have triggered me.

1: I've always been worried about my dog and the kids interacting (supervision ofc) because he seemed to not like them, but never did anything to them (bite, nibble). But he would follow them in the kitchen where his crate is placed. The kids have been cautious of him but sometimes they like to tease him from behind the gates we have installed in the home. We've taught them not to each time, but the kids are still young and learning. At the present, it seems fine/no issues but it still stresses me out to think about the possibilities of my dog biting them.

2: The reason for the fear of biting is because he has bitten an older family friend on the arm before. This was last year 2017. Situation was settled, I've brought him to dog training again (comprehensive, positive reinforcement, etc). However, my mother recently told me he almost bit my aunt's arm who came to visit while I was not home. I was away all day, and he needed to be let out of his crate once in a while to go outside. Note that I was gone for the weekend and he usually shows bad behavior when I leave for periods of time like that.

3: Also winter 2017, he had a play date with my best friend's dog. They knew each other since I got him. The downside was that her dog was NOT a 74 pound Akita, it was a 25 pound medium sized beagle mix. And unfortunately, her dog got stuck under my dog and there was a a situation. Since then, I haven't let my dog play with anyone else's and kept him solo. I take him on walks when no one else takes their dog out. Unfortunately last month, we encountered a lost/stray dog on our walk back home. The other dog started coming at us and my dog grabbed him and threw him to the side and it walked away. I've been told this particular situation, my dog wasn't wrong by many people. But to me, I was just glad my dog didn't kill him instead of thinking ""good job for being a good guard dog and protecting me"".

I've thought about bringing him with me to a new home that allows him but they've all been out of my budget, I simply can't afford it alone. But I can not stand being in the family situation at home either. If I knew about the family situation in advance, being completely honest, I would have never gotten a dog. I love my fluffy baby, but love isn't enough sometimes. I feel I know the answer is to re-home him, but I feel guilt by my family, friends and myself. ",[Help] Re-homing my dog thoughts,dogs
1338,"My poor Shaiya had to be euthanized Tuesday after being with us for 9 years, as her lungs were more than 2/3rds full of fluid. She was the love of my life. She was so kind and gentle, and all she wanted to do was either a) sit with you quietly and watch the world go by (with lots of pets, of course), or b) swim. She was so precious to me and was always there if I was upset or feeling alone. I have been accumulating pictures of her and I want to share her with you.

My dad‚Äôs ‚Äútherapy dog,‚Äù as we like to call him; has lymph node cancer.
My dad has had him the past 7 years. Ironically ; my dad has lymphoma too!
We don‚Äôt know what happened; this started in January; we thought it was just an infection.
We took VERY good care of him; all natural food; turmeric; spring water only; constant exercise. 
He was a rescue dog; he was on tranquilizers a little bit; he also had all his shots and vaccines and maybe the park had too much pesticide?? I don‚Äôt know!
He just turned 13; I live far away now and can‚Äôt make it back to see him.
He made it all these months but now his lymph nodes on the neck are so swollen he can barely breathe; we don‚Äôt know what to do!?

My dog is called Winston. So named after Winston Churchill. He's a dog which I received from a small town in Wales. I paid ¬£100 for him. He has had 3 previous owners, and he's only 2 years old. He came to me in a state I can only describe as...damaged. He was extremely naughty, hyperactive and persistently a LOT of work. But I stuck with him. The trust issues that he had and may still have were/are very visible. He's a loving dog, he just doesn't understand how him running all over my furniture and barking 24/7 causes problems. But I stuck with him. I showed him as much love as I physically could. Walked him a lot. Fed him at regular times. Took him to training and what not. I put effort into him. He's been with me just under 6 months now. I feel that given how quickly he gave himself up to me and my family, being passed on 3 times must have hurt him each time. He's still worried and upset every time we leave the house. He's a dog with many imperfections, but such a sweet and loving heart. He couldn't be better than he is, or try harder than he does. At this stage, he's gotten a lot better. He sleeps at the foot of my bed each night, he greets me with the utmost glee every time I step through my front door.

He's just, amazing. Whilst sometimes I'd love to see the back of him, as he is very difficult, I wouldn't swap him for all the money in the world. He's just amazing. How much calmer and happy he's become from just being treated well and being loved sincerely is incredible. I don't think the 3 previous owners were bad, as he is a HANDFUL. But I can see the impact it had on him. The hardest part of knowing him will be losing him one day, the thought brings a tear to my eye. I cherish every moment spent with him.

\*\*This is very soppy but he's having surgery right now and his chances are 60% of pulling through. I may not get him back. So this is, I guess, something of a last report of the immense positive impact he had on my life if he doesn't pull through. I'll update if you're interested.

1341,"My roommate and I used to get along.  We also used to help each other out when it came to caring for our respective dogs (hers a shepherd mix, mine a shih tzu mix).  When we moved into a new apartment, my roommate's dog developed severe separation anxiety where she barks incessantly when left alone.  Turns out this was behavior that my roommate was aware of, it's just that our old neighbors never complained about it, and she never bothered to tell me about it.  Well, our new neighbors have been complaining nonstop about the noise.  The level of care my roommate's dog now requires in order for her to stay quiet is beyond any commitment I am willing to make as a roommate.  Sure, walking her when my roommate is running late every so often, that's fine.  But my roommate thinks it's OK to leave her with me all week, all day and all night, because I work from home.  Well, due to the barking issues I can't leave the apartment AT ALL when she leaves her dog with me.  I can't take my dog out, I can't even take the trash out.  She keeps coming up with band-aid solutions to the separation anxiety issue without addressing the underlying behavioral problem (such as buying one of those treat dispensing toys and having neighbor's dogs stay in our apartment during the day to ""keep her dog company.""  She's also handed out a bunch of keys to our apartment to people I don't know without consulting me so there are neighbors constantly in and out of my apartment to come get their dogs.)  The situation has gotten so bad that I just don't work from my place anymore and mainly stay at a friend's place.  Now she is blaming me for having to make arrangements for her dog because I'm never home to watch it.  What has your experience been with taking care of a roommate's dog?  What is acceptable as far as relying on a roommate to care for your dog?  Me, personally, feel that if you are not capable of taking care of the dog on your own you shouldn't have a dog in the first place.  But that's just me, and I'm just looking for advice on how to deal with this situation.  Thank you.",[Help] Roommate thinks I'm her live-in dogsitter,dogs
1342,"My Springer Spaniel, Winston, has never shown any hint of a mean bone in his body, although he was surrendered to the shelter for being an ""asshole.""  Every stranger that's come to our house, Winston just wants to make friends with.  Same thing if we meet a stranger on the street (my neighborhood is nice, so I've never wanted him to protect me).  He loves all dogs, but if they get to be too much, he lets them know.  But today, he tried to protect me, and it just cracked me up.


We were walking on our usual route, and since it's coming up on elections, there's a bunch of campaign yard signs everywhere. Winston didn't care at all until we came upon a sign that wasn't in a yard, just on the side of the road.  When he saw it, he stiffened and wouldn't move. I was looking around, trying to see what he was upset about. The only thing out of the ordinary was this sign.  So I tried to get him to keep walking, and he ran in front of me and let out a loud bark and started growling, neither of which he EVER does.  He would not approach the sign and just kept growling.  So I just started chuckling and decided to turn around.  Every few steps, he turned around and growled, to make sure the evil sign wasn't coming after us.



Thanks, Winston, but I'm pretty sure the evil sign isn't coming after us.  But A+ for effort.

1343,"Aaargh :( our six-month-old Bodeguero cross (rescued at four months)  is generally a bit hyperactive/overexcited anyway, which is fine - we're working on it and she's getting much better with consistent training.

But as many puppies do, she sometimes has a ""witching hour"" at 6/7pm when she forgets *everything* and acts like a bratty little land shark. She barks at everything if we're out and about, pulls madly on her lead (she never does this usually) and bites when trying to play (not bites to hurt, but playful bites that she *usually* knows humans do not tolerate).

It's cool, I know this is something that will get better with age... but for the last two days she's been like this *constantly* and I'm exhausted and concerned in equal measure. She's been barking whenever she's been in the garden (even if just for a wee), being unruly and downright dangerous on walks (lunging at the road!!), leaping everywhere and trying to eat any random object/furniture she can see when we're inside, and just generally being impossible. It's like she's trying to kill herself or me before the weekend lol.

Is there something wrong? Is this normal? Will it pass? Can I help her? I know she's getting as frustrated as I am, because she can see that I'm getting tired and anxious and that must be upsetting for her.

Edit: she just had a checkup at the vet's two days ago so unless she's done herself a mischief I think she's pretty healthy

1344," I‚Äôm actually getting so tired of this.

Accidents happen. Mistakes are made. Dogs slip out the front door in excitement, bust through windows to chase squirrels, freak out and hop fences. They break leashes and snap collars. They‚Äôre strong, they‚Äôre big, they‚Äôre small, they‚Äôre nimble, they‚Äôre fast‚Ä¶accidentally escaping happens. Getting lost happens. Getting separated from owners who dearly love them happens.

Getting stolen happens. Getting snatched from the front of the bodega happens.

There was a time where we were dog-sitting my mom‚Äôs boss‚Äôs awesome little mutt. He‚Äôs half mini aussie, half toy fox terrier, all beautiful. Merle, with heterochromatic eyes. We were giving him his afternoon walk and this shady fucker sidles up to us mid-walk asking, ‚ÄúDoes he still have his balls? We have a female at home.‚Äù That asshole tried to snatch the dog. He was being so pushy, constantly coming too close, and constantly reaching over Tim. We took Tim and hightailed it home so unbelievably fast.

There‚Äôs a picture up on the dogist right now. A beautiful dog, a mix, but really, it‚Äôs almost certainly an APBT or an APBT mix.

The owner‚Äôs comments say they ‚Äúfound him,‚Äù tied to a pole, in Manhattan. In *Manhattan* they found him tied to a pole. Do you know how abysmally rare it is to find a dog abandoned on a pole in Manhattan? Conversely, do you know how very common it is find a dog tied to a pole because its owner‚Äôs slipped into starbucks to pick up a coffee?

Maybe they waited around for the owner and no one came. Maybe I‚Äôm being a cynic.

But the post reminded me of the awful amount of people in this world who will do anything to pretend they‚Äôre the champion of the dog they essentially stole.

‚ÄúOh I rescued him. (You see his owner had left him in the gated front yard for a run and he had a smudge of dirt in the fold of skin between his front toes, so I took him, because he was obviously abused!)‚Äù

I‚Äôve seen ones like that floating around a few times. I‚Äôve seen it a lot with cats in real life. Fuck off. You stole that animal. Bottom line.

Or that dog you found wandering around the street with matted, dirty fur? Yeah, you have no idea what his story is. You have no clue if he got separated from his people somehow. You don‚Äôt fucking know if someone is out there desperately looking for their dog. You have no clue how far and how fast a frightened and lost dog can travel.

You should check to see if the dog has s microchip. You should check to see if that dog has a loving family who wants him back.

A few months ago, I was going to pick up toys at the pet store (for Tim, again). As we‚Äôre making our way there a woman is walking in front of us with a beautiful APBT. Like an actual APBT. Perfect condition. Female, red, shiny, healthy coat, nice weight, young, maybe 10 months or so. Bad leash manners, but a beautiful, well cared for dog.

Well, I‚Äôm pretty much following them and hear the whole conversation she‚Äôs having with her friend. She found the dog two days ago, wandering around the neighborhood. She found the dog *in that condition*. She‚Äôs keeping it! The dog needs her! (Her words, literally.) The friend asks if she took her to the vet for a check-up yet? ‚ÄúNo, not yet, I‚Äôll take her with (insert name of other fucking dog).‚Äù

I think about that incident often, and everything I did wrong. That dog obviously belonged to someone else. That dog was obviously owned by someone who cared for her deeply. And this awfully stupid, selfish woman who already owned a dog just decided it was hers. I should have taken pictures and posted them locally. I didn‚Äôt know what to do back then.

And she was so grossly proud. ‚ÄúYay, I just found this dog that obviously had a home, I‚Äôm going to keep it immediately and make no attempts to find the owner!‚Äù Stupid fucking shallow lady. I hope it destroyed all her pillows.

And finally, roommates. Beware of roommates. Room with people you trust. I‚Äôve heard way too many horror stories now of roommates feeling like they have some sort of claim to other people‚Äôs cats and dogs because they lived with them for a little while. They don‚Äôt, but some people just don‚Äôt give a rat‚Äôs ass.

Just. Bottom line. Always beware the crazy amount of delusional fucking people in this world who will go to any length to get a free pet while claiming they did it for the betterment of the animal.",That dog you found doesn‚Äôt just automatically belong to you.

1348,"Hey all! (This got longer than expected so the last bit has my main question and brief desctiption of problem!) This is my first young dog, and my first own dog (my family has always had a dog, but we've always adopted older dogs). I have a 2 yr old Austrailian shepard. I adopted him from another family with two young kids (one was 7/8, one was a toddler) and I was told he got along well with them and was never told abt any problems with kids. Ever since ive had him (abt 8 months), he hasnt done well with smaller children (hes never bit them, but he does go after them but its never seemed like aggression), so ive just made sure to keep him away from small kids, no worries since we dont live with any and mostly go out in the daytime (during school hrs) before I work so we typically dont see kids.

However, the issue im more worried about is that every time we have the TV on and the show playing has the sound of a baby crying, he always jumps up, starts barking (as if someone is at the door, not quite his Mean Bark) and running /pacing the house. I try to mute it if i can tell it may happen, but im not always paying direct attention to it or know it will happen. Is there any reason for this, or way i could train him to not freak out? Hes a very smart dog but is very stubborn. (I actually need to put him through obedience training again bc even though hes trained and i am firm with him he only decides to listen abt half the time, and unless i have a direct incentive (toy, treat) I usually have to tell him the command multiple times before he will do it.

Anyways, I'm rambling.  Is there anything I can do to help curb this behavior? It gets frustrating/annoying sometimes and especially since I work late and if I come home at 12am  and want to watch a few episodes of friends before bed, I dont want to worry abt him running around barking and waking up my parents every time a baby cries on the tv.

1351,"My two dogs, both 8 years old, fill my heart with so much joy. But, sometimes a lot of frustration. 

My male German Shepherd will eat anything you put in front of him. Dry dog food, wet dog food, any type of treat, veggies, fruit, peanut butter. He is the canine equivalent of a garbage disposal- minus the garbage. **since I stated I give him fruits, veggies, and peanut butter, I have read extensively from different sources and made sure all information bases are covered on what is safe and unsafe for dogs to consume. I am very careful to read the ingredients list on peanut butters to make sure none contain artificial sweeteners.**

My female Husky, bless her heart, is a little more..... *difficult*. She will also eat dry and wet dog food. Veggies and fruit? Forget it. Peanut butter? Nope. If you give her a slice of cheese though, she will scarf it down before you blink. 

Yesterday while at the pet store I decided to pick up a bulk bag of treats since we ran out awhile ago and I felt bad I would ask them to perform a trick and had no reward for them. They like physical rewards like petting and the Shepherd also enjoys being rewarded with toys, but of course Miss Priss doesn't play with ANY toys, so giving them both treats is just easier. So anyways, here I am in the pet store. I am scouring the treat section for at least 10 minutes, looking over brands, flavors, best prices, etc. I decide to go with a bulk bag of Chicken and Cheese flavored treats. I figured this would be acceptable for Her Highness since she loves sliced cheese. 

I get home beaming with pride and confident that I have made a choice that would be approved by my picky eater. I load up the treats while they were outside to prevent them from hounding (hehe pun) me. When they came in, I asked for a trick and they did what I asked. I hand a treat to my Shepherd who of course loves it. I hand one to my Husky and she takes it, holds it in her mouth for a second, SPITS IT OUT, and looks at me with a level of disappointment a parent would have if their child brought home bad grades. In the Queen's eyes, I was merely a peasant. I tried to give her another one today, same reaction. Since she left it on the floor my vacuum of a Shepherd went to eat it and she ran over and blocked him. I figured ""oh good, she wants the treat but just needs to adjust to the flavor."" NOPE. This hussy didn't want the treat, she just didn't want HIM to have the treat. 

I swear, she was sent here by the Devil himself to irritate me. But, I love that picky, prissy, bitchy blue eyed monster.","[Fluff] DAE have a prissy, picky eater?",dogs

1355,"Hey all, so it‚Äôs been quite a dramatic last couple of days.. 

My dog is an 11 year old beagle who was recently attacked outside our home by a wild animal. I have a suspicion it was a fox but from what I hear it‚Äôs unusual for them to attack dogs but I‚Äôve seen one in the area recently. My mom suspects a raccoon but honestly we do not know, the vet we took her to said it was likely a larger animal and judging by the puncture marks it had an intent to kill. We didn't see or hear anything during the attack, we had just let her out to do her business as normal, she wasn't even out for much more than 5-10 minutes when we heard her barking. We went to let her in and she darted inside the house with her tail in between her legs. She was covered in blood but when I looked outside I didn't see any other animal but there was blood all over the driveway near the back door so she was attacked literally a couple feet from the door...

She was bit multiple times on the back of her neck as well as around her throat.. we managed to get her to the hospital within the hour of the attack and they told us she would need surgery and she spent the night there.
When we picked her up the next day she had been stitched up in what looked like 8 different areas around her neck as well as what looks like a gauze strip near her jugular. They also seemed to have stitched these plastic tubes in some of the puncture wounds to drain blood and fluids I‚Äôm guessing but it‚Äôs been a day and we haven‚Äôt seen any build up or drainage..

Needless to say we‚Äôre getting very worried, she won‚Äôt eat anything, every time my hand even comes close to her mouth she sniffs it then flinches away and backs up away from me looking frightened. The thing is she looks like she wants to eat, she‚Äôll act like she‚Äôs hungry but then when we try getting her food she sniffs it then turns away,.. To get her to drink we have to get a ladle and scoop up water and put it near her mouth but even then she sometimes acts the same as if we are trying to feed her. In addition to this we catch her going to the kitchen in what we think is to eat and drink but she only ever puts her paw in the water dish, but then when we try doing the ladle tactic that has worked sometimes, she ducks away.

We‚Äôre bringing her back to the hospital now but honestly the anxiety and feeling of helplessness is really getting to me and just hoping to hear from anyone on if they‚Äôve gone through something similar with their dog and how they were able to get them healthy and eating/drinking again. Getting her to take her pills has been a whole entire issue in itself so if anyone has any tips on doing that I‚Äôd really appreciate it, thank you.

1356,"We all love our dogs, and puppies are so cute, but when is it ethical to breed when dogs are so overpopulated? 

Is your pet registered with a reputable registry? These include AKC, FCI, UKC, CanKC (and full breeding rights within the registry). There are many other registries, but they often are fake or do not require ancestry or breed type within them. If your dog is not, then spay/neuter.

Where does your dog come from? If your dog came from a backyard breeder, shelter, pet store, found the dog, rescued the dog, etc. you shouldn't breed. Why? You have no idea of the dogs history, what genetic issues may be in its line and what its lines contain. Issues within the genetics may not be displayed in your dog, but will be passed on. Spay/Neuter your dog if they came from these circumstances. 

Does your dog have a 3-5 generation pedigree? Again, you want to know exactly what is going into the dog you are breeding, what issues the lines have, what could happen genetically if you breed this dog. If you dont have that, do not breed. 

In your dogs pedigree, does it have direct working or show lines within it? At least 3-5 dogs in close generations. This is so that you know that the purpose you are breeding your dogs for will have a much higher chance of occuring within the puppies. Breed for a purpose, not because puppies are cute or to make money. If your dog does not have this in their lines, spay or neuter. 

Now, does your dog have a stable temperament? Despite what people may say, temperment is largely genetic. You want a dog that not only has a good temperament, but the perfect temperment if you are going to be passing that temperment down. 

Have you competed or shown your dog in an unbiased, third person setting to see if your dog fits the breed standard and is able to perform its purpose? Again, we are not breeding just to breed, we are breeding to fulfill a purpose. The dog needs to show that they are adapt at their job (agility, hunting, guarding, conformation, herding, ect) by a third party before being bred. Why a third party? Your dogs are always perfect in your own eyes. If your dog does not perform well, do not breed. 

Now we have weeded out many dogs, but we still have a ways to go. Has your dog completed OFA testing and genetic testing? Only the healthiest of stock should be breed. This will help dogs live longer, avoid genetic, preventable maladies, and live life to its fullest. We love our dogs, we want them to live long happy lives. If your dog fails any of the many health tests, please spay or neuter. 

Getting closer to breeding time. Your dog seems like they are top notch, great breeding stock at this point. Now its time to consider the puppies. You want them to go to great homes. If you are not able to take back a puppy at any point during its life, do not breed. We want to avoid puppies going to shelters. It is a lifelong responsibility to breed, as those puppies are a dorect result of your actions and you need to back them up. If you cannot do this, do not breed. 

Send out all puppies on a spay/neuter contract unless you meet someone you trust will hold these standards of breeding. Again, you are responsible for these dogs, and not all of them should be bred.

Are you ready financially and emotionally? Breeding is expensive. You will have dogs that dont meet these standards. You will have emergency vet bills. You will have dogs die, for seemingly no reason at all. Can you handle that? If not, please spay or neuter. 

Now, we are at the end. If you and your dog are able to do all these things it is now time to decide if you should breed. If you can do this, it will be an ethical breeding. Go ahead and breed your dog.

If you are unwilling or your dog is unable to meet these requirements, you are backyard breeding and adding to the issue of shelters and unhealthy dogs. Please spay and neuter to prevent 'accidental' litters if you cannot commit to the strigent requirements ethical breeding requires. ",[Discussion] When should you breed your dog?

1359,"It's a lot to read but for the sake of the dog's happiness and my own ability, please read.

Went through a lot of researching within the specific breed on what to expect - training, walks, finances, etc. Bought all supplies beforehand even oddities like a shower attachment to wash your dog easier, GPS tracking for a collar, training books, clickers, etc. I then purchased a Labrador Retriever, Finn (male), 10/07/18 at the age of 15 weeks, its been 5 full days at the time of this posting. A part of me felt more prepared than all my other friends who own \[older\] dogs, but once I got him in person, I felt the opposite.

I'm currently enrolled in college for Biochemistry Molecular Biology, Medical Physics, and a math minor - **yet** still thought I could handle having a pet in the apartment. I am home 80% of time time studying or doing homework as my classes are short. I don't have a nightlife. My schedule is as follows: awaken, eat, class, Study for 8-12 hours, watch 1 or 2 episodes, practice mandarin, eat, sleep (so you see i'm mainly home). 

The Labrador's personality is calm, playful occasionally, poops and pees in the apartment, although I'm usually good at preventing that by timing his meals. **Hasn't barked once** and rarely whines. Likes to follow me around as if he was a duckling. Sleeps **a lot**, im talking many hours (of course). Hates having to go outside, even though once he is outside he likes to run and play. I live on the 4th floor with no elevator so I carry him up and down (I don't mind it) to prevent hip dysplasia from developing.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get odd for me: I feel stressed out to the max now, not because of the course load but just naturally from owning this dog's life. It's a 'worry' feeling. He hasn't been crate trained yet, he chewed through on an **almost** live wire leading to my lamp the other day, except I had known they love to chew everything in sight so I keep everything unplugged or hidden. I never know if one day i'll forget to put something away and it will cost him his life (ADHD-C Diagnosed - lost my dual citizenship birth certificate once...). Everytime I travel to campus my only worry is, ""Will finn be okay today alone for an hour or 2 max""? When instead it should be ""Am I ready for this Organic or Physics exam""? On top of that I love seeing my parents every odd weekend but that's a 4 hour drive (dont have A/C until next weekend when its fixed so windows down), so next weekend I am **really worried**. The last 2 car rides I could tell were really scary for him. Every bump on the highway and he would start breathing really fast and try to look around to see what it was. After all this researching I thought I had the time needed to invest in a dog and what to expect from a puppy imprinted in my head. All rooms in the apartment have been puppy-proof but each time he goes into a room im not, I feel like I have to be there watching his every move so he doesn't hurt himself, chew the carpet or wood, etc. I know I can't do that though because that easily gets in the way of studying, but I want to - so it becomes distracting anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, the stress got to me so much, I actually did return him to the breeder last morning. They were happy to take him back, resell him, and give me 'most' of those profits back as a refund. I didn't care about the money at all, I didn't expect them to give me a dime back. I just wanted the puppy to go to a family with a backyard, with adults and children with more time than me, and overall just more options for the puppy. However, 2 hours after I returned him I immediately felt depressed, cried because of how different it already felt without him, and made an impulsive move to drive back to the breeder and get him back. I told myself I would **everything** work out, but now i'm second guessing that. 

Was I just being selfish for wanting the dog back regardless of his own living conditions here with me? Do I return the dog back **again** for the last time?

1361,"Hey everyone! 

I‚Äôve been looking for a Pembroke Welsh Corgi breeder on the East Coast for some time now. I began my search in the PWCCA directory, and then looked through the more narrow PWC Club of the Potomac. I‚Äôve messaged some of the breeders, with varying results. Most have not responded, and many have websites that haven‚Äôt been updated since 2014 or so. The few who have responded are not planning any litters or have fully filled their waitlist for the upcoming puppies.

I began to Google breeders, with pretty poor results. I‚Äôm located near PA, so you can imagine the number of BYB and puppy mill sites I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôve found some breeders who appear to be responsible, and I have been messaging back and worth with one specific breeder.

Now, here‚Äôs my problem: I‚Äôm aware of the red flags that I should be watching for, but as this will be my first dog raised solely by me, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm considering too many things to be red flags, or if I‚Äôm falling prey to a really good liar.

The breeder I‚Äôm asking about has been responding to me over email and answering my questions. Her website has all of the typical breeder things: a copy of the contract, a page for the dams and sires, pages with past litters, information such as puppy care suggestions and veterinary information, etc. The website is poorly constructed, but the information is mostly there. 

What concerned me is the lack of proof of health testing (she mentions it, but there aren‚Äôt copies of the results or anything). I emailed her asking about this specifically, and she gave me more detail on it. She said she health tests for vWB and DM. She says her older dogs have been tested for EIC, but that she does not do this for her newer ones. She also said she does not do OFA, as she finds it to be unreliable. This last part is my biggest concern. I‚Äôve seen folks saying that an OFA score is absolutely necessary, but I‚Äôve also seen some people combatting this, saying that it isn‚Äôt necessary for all dogs, and that its significance is overhyped. 

She also says she does her own deworming. She says she has a vet that will provide vaccines, as well as provide the papers with the puppy‚Äôs vaccine and worming history, and will provide examination in the weeks leading up to the puppy coming home. She said the vet will also provide a suggested schedule for vaccines. Is this normal? I do not know if breeders should be administering the deworm nor if she should already be providing me with vet records for the dam and sire. I haven‚Äôt committed to anything and am just inquiring, so I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs why I haven‚Äôt received any official forms.

Upon purchase, she says she will provide the full AKC papers. Her contract requires the dog be spayed/neutered. She says she will take the dog back at any point in its life should I not be able to care for it. 

She says that I am welcome to come and visit her dogs, and that she can provide videos as well (I live 6 hours from her, and while I will absolutely visit before making any commitment, the video thing somewhat eases me). She also says that the full payment isn‚Äôt expected until time of pick up (though a deposit must be made if I am on the waitlist and agree to a puppy from a litter- this seems normal). She says she breeds 2 litters a year. Her site indicates that she has multiple dams, so this doesn‚Äôt appear to be concerning.

She said that she can provide references if I‚Äôd like them. I am curious if I should do this. She also provided photos of her dogs when I asked, and I did a reverse google image search just to make sure they weren‚Äôt stolen (they were not stolen).

I am worried if I am being too paranoid, or if there are red flags here that I am missing. My main concerns are the lack of official paperwork present on her site, and the lack of OFA testing. How should I go about inquiring about this? Is this a big deal, or am I putting too much stock into the OFA test/physical vet records?

I am inquiring about a litter that will not be available until 2019 (summer). It is not urgent nor am I being pressured to make a decision, I am just curious if this seems reputable or not. (Note: though I‚Äôm inquiring about this planned litter, she‚Äôs mentioned that there‚Äôs not promise I‚Äôll get a puppy, and that it‚Äôll depend on if the puppy seems to be a good fit.)

1369,"I'm looking for advice or comments from people who have been in this situation or similar situations! I appreciate any feedback. TLDR at the end. 

 My dog has attacked three separate large breed male puppies in the last 12 months. He has caused very little damage during these altercations, but they're VERY scary and do not end until his jaws are pried off, resulting in superficial scratches that have not required a vet visit. These situation do have similar, clear triggers, as well. More on that later....

First a bit about my dog. He's a neutered male pitbull 75lbs. I raised him the first three years of his life in a big city where he had loads of socialization and exposure to other animals and people. Busy streets, noisy dump trucks, apartments with elevators, the whole shebang. He is amazing with men, women and small children. He loves my mothers miniature dachshunds and all other small dogs and is happily fascinated by kitties that let him get close enough to sniff (which doesn't happen often). He was raised with my good friends' female dogs, and currently lives with my boyfriend's small female spaniel (30lbs). 

&amp;#x200B;

During his fourth year, I moved out to the country and have encountered a few large breed male puppies in tough situations. The first, a \~1yr old male akita. He is already as big as my dog. He belonged to the guy I was renting a room from, who spent many months of the year living elsewhere. So, I move my dog in just the two of us, get settled, then 4-5 weeks later, the owner moves back in with his akita. There is understandably some weirdness between the two dogs regarding territory. It was a failure on my part to take this seriously enough. I witnessed a few frustrated nips toward the akita when he got too up in his business, but again, my dog has a great record of submitting and avoiding conflict in his highly-socialized history, so I sternly chided him when I saw these nips, and diffused the situation and left it at that. However, my dog all out attacked the akita one day when the akita approached while he was getting pets from the owners girlfriend. (I was, frustratingly, not present for this or I am confident I could have seen his frustrated signs and controlled the situation better). The owner of the house had to physically pry him off, lift him from the ground and throw him into my bedroom to stop the altercation. His giant fluffy Akita was unharmed except for some light scratches that made it through his fur. No people were harmed. I was heartbroken and truly shocked when I heard about this, and quickly made different living arrangements. During this interim, my dog stayed in a house with the female spaniel and an older male mutt with no incident. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other incident was another large male american bulldog pup \~1yr old, already bigger than my dog in frame (but still lanky and probably weighed a bit less). This incident is the most upsetting to me because I consider it to be entirely my fault, I created a bad situation and didn't act on my instincts quickly enough. I'm sitting at a bar with my dog sitting obediently at my feet, I'm feeding him the occasional treat when he sits quietly, which is how I trained him to do so in busy, public spaces. The bulldog pup and his owner come in through the back door without me seeing and the pup runs up to greet my dog in typical unreserved puppy fashion. I am immediately on guard and make a move to put my dogs leash on (an instinct I should have followed through with) but they were sniffing with wagging tails and the bulldogs owner was like 'oh look they're okay"".  The bulldog continues his rambles and my dog goes back to sitting at my feet and I make mistake number one million that I made that night, and pull out another treat to reward my dog for disengaging from the pup and returning his attention to me. Before I know it, the pup is back and nosing my dogs lips and mouth for his own treat. I get one flash of my dogs lips pulling back and get out one ""No!"" before my dog is on the pup, pinning him on the ground. The pup is SCREAMING and my dog is making terrifying noises. I try the wheelbarrow technique to no avail. The pups owner is punching my dog repeatedly in the face/head. My boyfriend eventually pries his jaws off the pups lip, cutting up his fingers in the process. I am expecting carnage, I'm expecting someone to shoot my dog down in the street after what he's done. The pup.... is fine. I think there might have been a light scratch on his lip where he was being held but both the owner and I couldn't find anything amiss when we examined him directly afterwards. The owner is still understandably pissed (it's a small town, she knows the akita's owner). I feel so guilty despite the pup being okay. It may be worth noting that once my dog is yanked off, I'm holding him up and he immediately goes limp and is obedient again. He doesn't continue going for the dog, nevertheless I immediately remove him from the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I am upset and tell my friend and neighbor the story to get her advice. She then reveals to me that the week before my dog had pinned her (again, \~1 year old, male) pitbull to the ground. She brought my dog over to her place and her dog had a bone. My dog went for it, they scrapped, my dog came out on top and had him pinned by the neck and had to be pried off. My friend said she didn't tell me about it because she is a strong believer in ""dogs will be dogs, they scrap sometimes"" and there was no serious damage, just one or two light scratches that scabbed up the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am SO upset.  I would never allow my dog to be in an enclosed space with another dog with a toy or bone. My neighbor had good intentions, she was just giving my dog some care and attention while I was working long shifts that week, so I don't blame her at all, but I also want to rip my hair out that these things are happening when I'm not there. 

&amp;#x200B;

The incidents are piling up now and I'm well aware of the extra burden of being labelled ""a dangerous pitbull"" and am feeling like a dog-parent failure. My dog is strictly on-leash at all times now (I live in the country where everyone has a very laissez-faire attitude about leashes) and I no longer bring him out in the evenings when more people/dogs will be out. This breaks my heart because he was my drinking buddy when we lived in the city, and he's got that typical pitbull charisma and sweetness that makes everyone fall in love with him when they meet him. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's not unheard of that male dogs just don't get along with other males, and that this might just be how my dog is maturing, but I still feel like a failure. Anyone have advice or been in similar situations? Can this behavior be trained away, or simply avoided? All feedback is welcome. Unfortunately, the akita and bulldog are now persona non grata as far as my dog is concerned, I can sense aggressive vibes from him when he sees them around town. Needless to say, I avoid them at all costs and keep him under leash control at all times.

However, in the last 24 hours she‚Äôs pooped in the house 4 times, no matter how many times she‚Äôs been let out or how closely I‚Äôve been keeping an eye on her. 

It‚Äôs unusual for her to poop 4 times a day, let alone in the house.

1371,"Warning - wall of text full of ranting backstory.  Scroll to bottom for tl;dr

Okay so some back story here.  I have a 2 year old red heeler/lab mix.  This dog is my baby. This dog is my best friend.  This dog makes my heart warm and my face wet with all the licks.  A few months back my husband suggested we get a friend for her.  I laughed at the idea.  Puppy days were hell.  We made it through alive though and all is well. But then I started thinking . . . Hmm - maybe Marley DOES need a friend. I let the idea stoop for awhile and then I became obsessed with the idea.  I agreed.  Yes, Marley needs a friend.  So I found Luna.  Luna is a Husky/Shepard mix we found on craigslist.  She was 9 weeks old. In awe of cuteness I forgot how hard puppy days where.  It's been rough but we got past most of the hard stuff.

Luna is now 6 months old.  Luna did not get the one-on-one human time like Marley did.  Luna is not so good at listening.  Luna is not a cuddler like Marley.  Luna is mellow until shes playing, and then her and Marley are playing and jumpin and biting each others heals.  

Luna has become an escape artist, living up to her breed.  We have a 6ft privacy fence, but it's old.  We need a new one.  Luna has found out the bottom is easy to chew up and digging will get her out.  We have patched the fence the best we can but to no avail she will find a new spot.  When it's fixed for the time being she digs and digs and digs and then tracks mud and dirt through the entire house.  Every day I have to sweep 2-3 times a day and there is always more dirt. I hate the dirt. It's an every day hell at this point.

I am beginning to resent and regret this dog.  I do not like her.  She is cute and soft, but we dont have what I have with Marley.  Luna is not my dog.  Luna is her own dog.  My husband just opened his own restaurant and I work nights.  So someone is usually home, but I like to sleep during the day and I have to block the dog door so the dogs wont get out and destroy the fence, escape, and get hit by a car.  I never had this problem with just Marley. It's not fair for Luna to live in a house where someone does not love her.  I hate that I dont have that connection with her, but I just dont.  And that's not fair for her.  I hate that I feel this way, I really do. 


I put in some information tonight about surrendering Luna.  She's still a puppy so I feel like she has a better chance of finding a new home. Shes fixed, UTD on shots, chipped, and crate trained, good with dogs, cats, and children - I feel like shes got potential.  



Now the big question

How is this going to affect Marley?  Marley gets jealous of Luna.  Marley will cut between me and Luna to take all the lovins.  Marley likes to play with Luna but prefers her spot on the bed, right next to mom.  Will Marley be okay when we remove a dog thats been with us for 4 months now?  I like to think so, for my own sanity.  It breaks my heart thinking that this could upset her.  I already had the talk with my 9 year son and he is sad but understands that Luna needs a home with more one-on-one time and an up-to-date fence.  I cant have a talk like that with Marley though.  

I'm sorry this was so long.  I think I just needed to get this all out.  I even used my throwaway account because I feel so ashamed.  I've always preached ""pets are family, dont give up on them"", but it's just not fair to this puppy- every day I resent her more and more.  I miss it just being Marley.  My house is filthy, with the new business were broke and can't afford obedience school.  Even if we could afford it I work most nights with a differing schedule week by week so I dont know who would take her to class.  I told my family I needed help with training Luna and no one did a damn thing.  I'm the only one who ever worked with any of the animals.  This isnt a rant about my family though. Sorry.

1376,"Hello everyone!  I am at a loss and I thought I would try here.  I‚Äôve posted this on r/askvet as well, but I would welcome anecdotal advice. 

Basics:

Live in Midwest US

12 year old beagle, Roscoe, M, neutered, 31 lbs

Went blind about 4 years ago, healthy eyes, no cataracts, has adjusted great. 

Beginning to see signs of arthritis

Has eaten Hills Prescription Diet W/D for about 10 years due to pancreatitis and anal gland issues

Sensitive stomach - gets sick when eating other food, no table scraps

Takes prozac for separation anxiety and previcox, 60mg (half a pill) for the arthritis, adrotin chew for joint health

The situation:

He has always eaten like a beagle, from 8 weeks on.  Extremely food motivated, I've used a slow bowl since he was about 3.  In general, completely unstoppable around food.  One time he was staying at my parents and they didn't secure the dog food container.  He got in it and ate about 6 inches of food.  He was sick for days.  Just an example of his typical behavior around food.

We have been ordering the W/D from our vet's online pharmacy in bulk to get a discount, 6 bags at a time which lasts a year.  We ordered our most recent shipment in August.  He started the first bag from that new shipment right around the beginning of September.

We began to notice small things.  He hesitated for a few seconds before diving into the food.  This grew to a few minutes.  Then, when he would eat, he was dropping food out of his mouth.  It looked like he forgot how to eat - chewing with his mouth wide open, taking a long time to chew, eating just one kibble at a time.  After about a month, he just stood there in front of his food like he didn't know what to do.  He stopped eating the CET dental rawhides I gave him in his crate every morning - again, something he's done without question for about 4 years.  Very uncharacteristic behavior.  

I took him into our local vet. She examined his teeth, we ran bloodwork, and she prescribed an antibiotic just to make sure we covered our bases.  He didn‚Äôt react at all during the examination of his mouth. It definitely didn‚Äôt seem like he was in any pain there. All tests looked great, and no change from the antibiotic.  We tried getting the food wet.  Hand feeding him.  No change.   There was no vomiting, no change in stool during this time, no change in drinking habits, no change in any sort of behavior. 

Then, we thought to try another food.  I picked up regular Science Diet Sensitive Stomach.  He. Chowed. Down.  And he ate it normally - no dropping kibble, no strange chewing.  Ok, so it's the food!  I called Hills. They denied any sort of formula change.  I called my vet.  She suggested that if the food had stayed on the truck too long in the heat, maybe it went off or the flavor just went bad.  I went to PetSmart and got a fresh bag of the Hills Prescription Diet W/D.  No luck.  Again, he resumed the strange behavior.  Staring at his bowl - and when he does eat it, he eats like he doesn't know how.

He ate the Science Diet substitute for about 3 weeks and his stomach never adjusted.  He had loose stools the whole time.  If I mix the two to try to transition him, he only eats the Science Diet out - leaves the Prescription Diet in the bowl. 

The other night, I mixed some Hills W/D canned in with the dry kibble.  He ate it with enthusiasm - but again, not normally. Dropping the kibble, chewing it weird. 

I love this dog with everything I've got.  Part of me wonders if he has just changed his mind about what he likes and is being stubborn.  But he eats mulch in the backyard, he's never turned anything down, so I have no idea why he would be resisting this food.  If he doesn't eat and I pick up the bowl and try at the next meal, he won't go more than a day without giving in and eating.  But I don't want his last years to be spent like this, especially if something real is going on.  I just keep hesitating pursing this further at the vet since it seems like it‚Äôs a preference issue. If he was in pain or sick, why would he so enthusiastically eat the Science Diet substitute?  Any thoughts? ",[Help] Drastic change in beagle‚Äôs eating habits!,dogs

1378,"So I have a one and a half old English cream golden retriever. He has an *insane* amount of energy. Every other dog owner I talk to are astounded by how often I take him outside to play and go potty. When I'm home, and I am home almost all the time (I never go out really) I take my dog out every 1.5-2 hours. On these walks they last around 30-45 min each, and 7 out of his 9 daily walks I play fetch/run with him. When I get back home, he sleeps/rests for maybe 30 minutes, then he always comes to me and puts his paws on my arms letting me know he wants to play or go out. So, I play with him for maybe 10-15 minutes playing tug of war, giving him love, etc. When I try to go back to doing what I want, he just comes back and if I tell him to stop or wait he just sits down next to me and stares at me with those giant puppy eyes, not wanting to play with any of his toys or chew things or anything, it just seems like he wants to go outside and explore. I have way *too* many toys that I buy for him and he only has interest in them for the first day then he doesn't care about it. I have bought bully sticks and cow ears for him to eat so he can be distracted for a little bit, but he literally eats those treats up within 10 minutes, and you can't give those things to them that often. Anyone else have a dog that is so high energy like mine? Anyone have any advice on what I can do to make him chill out more? I mean I don't mind taking him out this often and I know he can hold in his pee/poo for more than 10 hours because i get 10 hours of sleep every night, but sometimes I just want to take him out and have him chill out for a few hours before I take him out again.

1382,"My girlfriend and I have a male dog. He is about 1-1/2 years old and the main issues we were having were the usual stuff (Tearing shoes/furniture items up, going potty in the house, ect) but as he got older that stuff settled down and wasn't an issue. He is at super sweet, loving dog and loves to play and has lots of energy.

We moved 3 hours to a new town because my GF got into a school so we moved him from her mom's house to our new loft/apartment. We had him there for 5 days and left him alone only one time when we came back to a note on our door. It was from a neighbor telling us he was barking and wining non-stop the whole 2 hours we were gone. Naturally, we were racking our brains trying to find a way to deal with this when the next morning we took him for a walk and our property manager was walking in the main hall. She is a sweet lady and loves dogs, so she reached down to pet him when he bit her. I take the blame for that because I let this leash go just a tad. That is the first time he has bitten anyone and the second time I've seen him do anything like that. The other time I was walking him in her mom's neighborhood and he jumped a this lady who stopped and talked to me. Anyways, after that we decided it would be best to send him back to live with her mom. It sucked but it had to be done.

The problem is I travel for work at random times and she's busy with school so we are limited at the moment. The plan was to move to a house after our lease was up and take him back. But now hes bitten 3 more people and I don't know what to do. I think it's mainly her mom letting him do whatever and not being stern with him. It's a weird situation but her mom works all weekend so my dad goes over Fri-Sun to feed and let him out in the mornings. My mom tagged along one day and he bit her in the arm pit. She said it was weird because he bowed down to her like he was submitting but then he attacked. Like he came at her, not she went to pet him and scared him. The other two people were the both neighbors. The first guy lets his dog run around without a leash and we've told him many times not to come up to our dog while we're walking because he's nervous. Her mom was walking him one day and the dude stepped too close to her and he bit. The other guy was also a neighbor, and it happened today. There is flooding going on in my home town currently so the guy and his dad came over to her moms house to get away from the flood waters and he bit the guy in the butt.

I'm at my wits end, we're planning on taking him to the vet next week to talk to them to see if we can figure something out and we've never had him formally trained, but we don't have a ton of extra money to do it and we won't even have him living with us for another 8 months. But of course all of this is going on when I'm working so I'm over 8 hours away and my GF has exams. Both of our parents have said ""everyone goes through their first dog..."" meaning it's common to give up or loose the first one. I know that sounds messed up and I don't want that but, if he bites the wrong person (Luckily everyone involved is super understanding and no one has called Animal Services yet) it's game over. I feel sick to my stomach about the whole thing. We still have 8 months on our lease and her mom clearly isn't keeping him under control, but he shouldn't be so aggressive in the first place.

Any ideas? I'm on the verge of tears but I need to stay clear headed for my GF because I know she's taking it harder than me.

**Introduction**

1. Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

No, this would be my third dog that I have trained personally

1. Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder](http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

A Reputable breeder

1. Describe your ideal dog.

A large, fun dog that is comfortable and confident in new situations. Maybe a little goofy. I want a dog that is always game to go on adventures, be those to the local stores or hiking. Aloof with strangers would be preferable, but I do not want aggression. A companion for my current dog, maybe, though I am aware that same sex aggression is a problem in many breeds I am looking at and would plan accordingly. 

1. What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

Beauceron, Rhodesian Ridgeback, GSD, Rottie. I know one of those is not quite like the others! Bigger, higher energy dogs that like to work with their handlers. I like the look of a big, intimidating dog, though I plan to handle any aggressors that come our way. 

1. What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

My current dog and I play Rally and Agility, and I love doing it. I'd like to get into nosework and maybe barnhunt or dock diving. And flyball always looks fun! I also need solid off-leash skills for long hikes and beach walks, and water recalls at the lake. 

**Care Commitments**

6.	How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

Probably a maximum of six hours, though for a puppy I would break that up, of course. 

7.	How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average? What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?

Probably not more than 2 or 3 hours of concentrated exercise. I would like a jogging and hiking companion. And if the dog needs more, I would be happy to teach him to run beside my bike, there's trails nearby that would be great for that. 

8.	How much regular brushing are you willing to do? Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home? If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

I will pay a professional, no matter what at least a few times a year for socialization and a good brushing and bath if nothing else. I kind of believe that brushing a dog is a team-building activity, so I am always happy to spend half an hour in front of the TV currying fur a few times a week.

**Personal Preferences**

9.	What size dog are you looking for?

BIG

10.	How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Barking is a non-issue. I would prefer not to be drowning in slobber, but if I have to carry a rag then I'll carry a slobber rag, it's no big deal. What do you mean dog hair isn't a condiment? 

11.	How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

The most important, honestly. And I will put all of the work into this and work with whatever trainer I need to.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12.	Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

Either is fine

13.	Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

I'd like a biddable dog that wants to work with me

14.	How would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard? How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?

Barking at the door would be good. I like an aloof dog with strangers, but I expect him to accept their presence if told. Not necessarily sit still for excessive petting if he doesn't want to. 

15.	Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

No. I'll avoid SSA and work on socialization.

16.	Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Aggression. I am not equipped to deal with it, but I will socialize that puppy to the gills for two years, minimum. 

**Lifestyle**

17.	How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

&amp;#x200B;

Eight hours a day, three days a week. I work from home the other two but might go in for an hour or two. If he likes daycare, that's an option. I also used rover for my current dog when she was younger, but she hates daycare and wasn't wild about working for a stranger. 

&amp;#x200B;

18.	What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog?

&amp;#x200B;

Just me.

&amp;#x200B;

19.	Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets? What breed or type of animal are they?

&amp;#x200B;

A dog and a cat. The dog is a Maremma

&amp;#x200B;

20.	Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

&amp;#x200B;

God I hope not. But I will take care to socialize him with children

&amp;#x200B;

21.	Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

&amp;#x200B;

I rent but will be buying a house soon, hopefully. My current place has no restrictions. 

&amp;#x200B;

22.	What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

&amp;#x200B;

none

&amp;#x200B;

23.	What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

&amp;#x200B;

It gets very hot in the summer, but winters are mild. 90 - 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 

**Additional Information and Questions**

24.	Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

25.	Feel free to ask any questions below.

1386,"So, my dog Luna is the first dog I ever had.  I've had her since she was a few months old and she just turned 5 recently!  Since I thankfully got her once I was a responsible adult, she has done everything from puppy behavior school to agility training.  

She's always been phenomenal with people and with other dogs, she's generally super submissive (when we're out on walks, if we run into another dog, her first move is to immediate rollover and expose her belly.  Similar behavior at dog parks too).  Me and my wife have been thinking about getting another dog so Luna has some company aside from the cats, but there's one thing that worries more and worried me even more so when I saw another post on here.

Luna is a mixed breed.  The shelter knew the mom so we know she's part Australian Cattle Dog, we don't know the other half but always assumed pit because of her body structure and brindle coat.  Luna has one bad behavior quirk that we've never been able to train out, mostly because it's not normally an issue.  I thought it might be dog aggression, but again, she's super submissive and does phenomenal with dogs outside the house, what I worry the behavior is, is resource guarding.

There have been two separate incidents that worry me.  The first was when we were fostering a senior puggle.  She was a typical older puggle, she was still young enough to run around a bit and play, but she rarely played with Luna, mostly didn't want to be bothered.  One day, when my wife was in the yard playing with Luna and the puggle, something happened, we still aren't clear on what and Luna bit the puggle under the arm, leaving a mark.  We took her to the vet and thankfully she wasn't seriously hurt, but we had to pass the puggle on to another home since we worried for her safety after that.

About a year after that, we started to petsit frequently for a friend.  The dog we were petsitting was about Luna's age, a hound mix, and while he was taller than her, she was still more built because of her breed.  The two of them got along like thieves and would often play together to the point of exhaustion and cuddle together.  Then we had an incident there too.  I would always make sure to feed Luna and the other dog in separate rooms because since she was a puppy, I know Luna has resource guarding issues with other dogs when it comes to food.  Apparently the info sheet I got from the shelter from the foster home told me that even when she was a puppy, she had to be fed separately from her siblings because she would growl at the other pups and not let them eat if she was eating.  So, that worked well enough with the dog we were sitting, until we didn't keep an eye on them for a few minutes while feeding.  Apparently, Luna walked from the kitchen into the other room where the other dog was getting fed and turned on him seemingly over the food.  Thankfully I was just in the other room and pulled her off in seconds and the other dog wasn't really hurt.  After that, we made sure to supervise them closely and their relationship didn't change.  They'd continue to play together till exhaustion, sleep together, etc.  We haven't sat that dog in a while, primarily because we were concerned about that one time.

My question with all of this is, we would love to get another dog one day.  I was hoping that if this is her trying to establish herself as the alpha or something, that if we got a larger male breed, those sorts of fights wouldn't happen, but I honestly don't know enough about the subject.  Does it seem like it's safe for us to bring a new dog into the house?  And if we do, what is the best way to go about making sure they get along and more importantly, that Luna doesn't feel threatened by the other dog in some way?",[Help] Can I safely get another dog?,dogs

1389,"This situation was the absolute worst timing ever.  We have a shy, 8 yr old, 6 lb chihuahua-pug and wanted to get a puppy.  After searching local rescues we found the puppy we wanted we brought our dog to meet her.  They weren't exactly friends but our dog sniffed a little and was mostly neutral, which we figured was about as well as a first meeting was going to go.  So we did all the paperwork, paid the non-refundable fee, and a week or so later we got the call that she was cleared by the vet to be picked up that Saturday.  

On Friday I was walking our little guy up to the bus stop to pick up our daughter.  On the way home, some kids went into the house a few doors down from us and their large dog ran straight out and grabbed our dog.  I won't go into to gory details because it was very traumatizing to all involved, but he needed to stay overight at the emergency vet.  He's fine now, but we had to get him from the vet the same day we brought our new puppy home.  He was on meds and crate rest in our bedroom for the first two weeks we had her.

Prior to this I was nervous about getting them socialized, but now it's not going well at all.  She's 16 wks old now and is several inches taller than him.  Our little guy won't even look at her.  You know if you try to show a dog to themself in the mirror and they look anywhere else?  That's how he acts.  Or if she tries to sniff him he growls.  I tried having her in the crate  or pen and him outside but he won't go near her at all.  I don't want to force him, but I'm at a loss.  The only way to get them close together is if one of us holds him and the other holds her, but again he tries to pretend she doesn't exist.  For her part she's about as respectful and controlled as she is capable, but I know if I let her go she will follow him and it won't go well.

",[discussion] outside time,dogs
1391,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

I owned a family pug when I was younger, but he was brought into my family when I was very young and I did not spend any time training the dog. 

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

I am not opposed to a rescue, but I would prefer a young puppy for its ability to bond and train as a younger more moldable dog.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

My ideal dog would be between 25-35 pounds, intermediate grooming, would enjoy weekly hikes. Must be able to be at home for at least 8 hours on it's own later on in life as I work 12 hour nursing shifts. Gets along well with a resident cat, eager to please and responsive to training and commands. 

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

I've taken the AKC quiz and landed on Boston terriers and Springer Spaniels a few times. I'm not keen on Boston terriers due to a past experience, and I'm not into the longer coats of the springer spaniels. I do need a small-medium sized dog and would like the breed to enjoy exploring.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

The basics are a given, sit stay come, ect. I would really like the dog to go to place, drop, impulse control, not chasing cars, ect. 

**Care Commitments**

6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

On days that I don't work I can guarantee up to 3-4 hours per day of direct interaction and whatever excess towards the end of the day. On days that I do work, I can see a pushed maximum of 2 hours plus extra time spent zombie walking around my apartment.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

I would expect to be able to take my dog on an hourly walk as well as a 30-60 minute visit to a dog park each day. On days that I dont work, I want to spend time on a hike either in town or outside of the city. We have some good trails surrounding a few creeks with a lot of open fields along one side.

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

I am open to bi-weekly grooming. I have an ante room before going into my apartment and I would be able to do some hardcore grooming there before heading inside. 

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

Small-Medium, 25-35#

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

Lint rollers exist, but having hair on my toothbrush is too much for me to manage. Slobber is not a huge deal so long as it isnt a constant everywhere sort of situation. Barking is the biggest concern as I am living in an apartment. I do have decent insulation for my neighbors and the room that the kennel would be in is directly over a stairwell. I think that as far as apartment acoustics go I am in a very good position. 

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

I would really want to be able to do this on hiking trip. I want to be able to let my dog off leash and allow her to roam but returns when called or goes out of sight. 

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

I suppose I would be in between. I would prefer a bit of alone time, but I would be more tolerant to more cuddles over more alone time. 

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that‚Äôs more eager-to-please?

Eager to please. For sure. 

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

I would prefer the dog ot be curious about what was going on, but hopefully not bark. I'm not opposed to barking as long as they are controlled when the guest comes into the home or yard. 

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

If my dog became aggressive towards other dogs, I would probably revert to complete dog isolation. I would choose to avoid all aggressive situations but wouldn't consider abandonment

16) Are there any other behaviors you can‚Äôt deal with or want to avoid?

Dog on human agression. I had a rescue that was reportedly good at home but became very protective when my ex came over. I do take fault for not properly introducing the two. 

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

Three days a week I will be working 12 hour shifts. I would pay to have a walker come get the dog for a half hour visit at 2200 to 2230, but I feel that I would have difficulty finding someone to come early in the morning. The other days I would prefer an hour of alone time, but otherwise I'd be all for a velcro companion.  

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

I live alone

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

I have an american short haired cat, 3-4 years old

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

No

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

I currently rent and forsee renting for at least the next 5-10 years. There is the common breed restriction on my lease and a 50# limit. I think it is for insurance purposes. 

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

I live in a state with minimal restrictive laws regarding dog breeds. 

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

Hottest summer day is 110, coldest winter day is -10. Average summer is about 85 and average winter is about 20.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

I am just finishing up with my college education and I would like to have a long term project to work once I am done. I also feel that the companionship a dog provides is one of life's treasures that I would love to be able to experience.

25) Feel free to ask any questions below.  ","[Breed] Looking at a Brittany, but open to suggestions.",dogs
1392,"
My husband and I recently adopted a 30 lb feist hound mix, about 2 years old from a local rescue, our first dog. We‚Äôve had her about 2 months, and she went from a fearful trembling ball to actually showing lots of affection and loving our company. She‚Äôs a sweetie. She can now go for a walk in our noisy neighborhood, is great at the dog park and is finally housetrained. (Construction in our neighborhood started a few days after we took her home, and it really did not help with her anxiety).

We signed her up for wag and for the most part she‚Äôs been great with strangers. However, in the past week or so, she has become very territorial in our home, barking, howling and growling at anyone that‚Äôs not us coming into our home. We hired a wag the other day, who was great, plied her with lots of treats (which we recommended) and she got about halfway around the neighborhood and started barking at him. Eventually he got her home and gave her more treats, but then a few days later, my sister in law (whom she's met a few times before) came over for beers, and she wouldn‚Äôt stop barking and howling at her. She even almost lunged at her, and paced around anxiously. This happened when she stood up, but wasn‚Äôt in her face.

Is she just getting comfortable enough to show her true personality now, or is she protective of us?  I‚Äôd like to nip this new behavior in the bud but I don‚Äôt know how. We recently signed her up for weekly obedience classes, so far she‚Äôs only been to one class and was fine. 

Again, up until now, she was anxious but ok meeting strangers. I've even brought her to work and she just wanders around sniffing people then goes to sleep. This seems like a relatively sudden change.

My first instinct was to take her to populated areas, and ask strangers to give her treats, which we‚Äôve had mixed success with. Unfortunately we don‚Äôt have that many house guests (or fortunately if she‚Äôs going to attack them!) to get her used to that. In 2 months we are also moving across town, where my commute will be longer and I‚Äôd like to set up a regular walker. I want to make sure she‚Äôs more comfortable with strangers before this happens, and I certainly don't want her howling and lunging at every stranger in our house.

1399,"Hi friends,

&amp;#x200B;

My poor pup has had CPV for a solid 2.5 months now (check out the pictures if you dare: [https://imgur.com/a/eNQie9F](https://imgur.com/a/eNQie9F)).  It started with one wart on his lip that clustered and grew to the size of large grape, and now his mouth is full of several more clusters of pink and gray ugliness.  He's got them on his lips, gums, tongue, roof of his mouth and one on the outside of his snout.  He eats, breathes and acts normally so I wasn't too worried about them, just extremely grossed out.  However, after the snout one grew larger I finally bit the bullet and brought him to the vet just in case, but she basically told me everything the internet already had.  One new recommendation from her was to engage him in lots of ""aggressive mouth play"" in order to help trigger his immune system into actually fighting these suckers back.  Sometimes when we play or when he chews a bone they start to bleed which is hopefully starting to wake up his immune system.

&amp;#x200B;

Now everything on the internet and my vet said CPV typically lasts 1-3 months.  As we're nearing the 3 month mark I am very hopeful they are going to start falling off.  His large grape sized wart has blackened and hardened up a bit, does anyone know if that's a good sign?  Also, he smells AWFUL.  Like I can't even describe how terrible his mouth smells.  It has gotten increasingly worse over the past few weeks.  I am hopeful that this is also a good sign?

&amp;#x200B;

For other owners with cases as bad as my dog's, what can I expect from here on out?  Do the warts literally just fall off, or should I be trying to pull or cut them off myself?  Does it happen one by one, or kind of all at once?  I am also getting a little worried that the warts have lasted this long, does anyone have experience with CPV lasting longer than 3 months?  My vet told me some cases may take up to 9 months to resolve themselves but I'm REALLY hoping this isn't what's happening here.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not interested in paying for vet treatment services as long as my dog is still able to eat and go about his daily activities normally.  However if anyone has any suggestions for affordable at-home treatments to look into I am definitely keen on trying them.

1400,"I've had my dog (silky terrier) since he was a puppy and I was 17 years old. He's now 16 years old. He's in great shape for his age. Slower than he used to be, but otherwise very healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

For most of his life he was good about not peeing in the house when someone was home. Being home alone was a different story - he'd pee on the for within moments of us leaving. Now that he's older, he has accidents more frequently while we're home. Wife and I work during the day and he's home by himself from 8am to 7pm. When we come home the apartment is covered in an enormous amount of piss and shit. Honestly, I'm not sure how he pees so much... It's as if there's more pee on the floor than there was water in the bowl. I've been fine cleaning up after him when we get home for the past decade but we've just had twin babies and they're starting to crawl around. Having excrement all over the floors is obviously not ideal, and it's the last thing I want to come home to after a long day of work. Also, we live in an apartment and his pee is destroying our floors and leaving a permanent urine scent.

&amp;#x200B;

We've considered dog walkers, but he has separation anxiety and having someone come into the apartment and then leave again would send him into a frenzy. It also wouldn't really solve the problem because even if he's walked right before we leave, he'll pee on the floor within 30 minutes of us leaving.

&amp;#x200B;

We've considered daily boarding but it would be \~$800/month to do that and the idea of paying for him to live with someone else for the vast majority of the day just leads me to ask why not just find him a new permanent home. Also, the added cost and time to drop off/pick up is not ideal in combination with the time and cost associated with twin infants.

&amp;#x200B;

We've considered wee-wee pad training (more likely, one of those grass patches you can buy), and this is still on the table. Not sure how successful it will be since a lot of his peeing is anxiety related.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, we're considering offering him to a Rover dog sitter that we really like. We've left him with the sitter on a number of occasions and it's like the two of them are in love. The sitter gives him much more affection than we do and she's home most of the time. When I pick our dog up, he is completely unexcited to see me. I know that with the sitter, he'll have a much better life. Obviously it's not a guarantee she'd take him, but it's a possibility. And if not her, we'd still be on the search for a new owner. For what it's worth, his separation anxiety is more about being by himself, not necessarily being away from us. He's perfectly happy when we leave him with family or sitters while we're on vacation.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is I haven't enjoyed having him as a pet for at least a decade. I've always taken good care of him out of a sense of obligation, but if you were to tell me at age 17 how many sacrifices I'd have to make to have a dog (mostly regarding living my 20's in NYC and trying to build my career), and that he would live to be at least as old as I was at the time, I'd never have gotten a dog. But, it's been that sense of responsibility that has kept me going all this time. During that time, he's gotten plenty of affection from my wife, family, and friends, and he's been a loyal companion by my side wherever I go.

&amp;#x200B;

The combination of having children and him becoming more high maintenance in his older age has tipped things over the edge for me and I'm feeling like we'd both be happier if I could find him a good loving home. That said, I do still care about his well being and if giving him to a new owner would be significantly bad for him, then I wouldn't want to do that. Any advice is appreciated.

1402,"It's not uncommon that a person decides to adopt a pet, usually by superficial enthusiasm and ignorance of what this adoption actually encompasses. The animal is cute and beautiful and most of the times there is a sense of animal welfare that drives people to make this decision. If it is a dog, the idea of adopting is often combined with the possibility of guarding the house, while keeping company to the children of the family which most likely be very enthusiastic to the idea of owning a pet. Most of the time, however, this need is compulsive or just something they saw in a movie and clicked.

Initially, there is a grace period, where the animal is healthy and lively. It is also a brand new experience for the owner. At this stage, problems and responsibilities are often overlooked. Very soon, however, they emerge sharper and end up in a fairly common picture: the animal is left stray on the road, in a remote neighborhood or in front of a clinic. In another case, the animal remains with the owner but is neglected to the extent that it arrives at the clinic in an advanced and far from a hopeful condition for its health and life.

An important responsibility of the vet is to attribute to the community the reality of what it means to adopt a pet in order for the owner to be well prepared and the animal to have the best possible living conditions. The emotional approach of an animal is the most basic but not the only factor in the adoption process.

###### The animal-human relationship

We usually mention only the positive aspects of the animal-human relationship: the animal is a wonderful companion that offers love in its own unique way asking for little in return, is proven to be a real friend and ""pedagogue"" for the children but also a great companion for the elderly. The dog can guard the house to a certain extent (depending on training and character). Young animals offer moments of laughter and carefreeness with their tricks and their cute nature. But with all these advantages, there are also several responsibilities that are easily overlooked and are not clearly stated to future owners.

It is, therefore, useful to mention the following issues regarding the adoption of an animal so that the prospective owner is aware of the responsibilities he will have to assume and the situations he is about to encounter by raising and caring for a pet:

###### The animal has specific nutritional needs.

If you are to adopt a pet, you should know that it can not be fed with meat or non-cooked meats (because of the risk of parasites and other infectious agents). Animals need to have a balanced diet and may need special foods under certain conditions (eg if they suffer from a disease, or if they are neutered). Good quality food, especially special nutrition, helps maintain the animal's health, but it is definitely an expense you should take into consideration.

###### The animal has specific medical needs.

In order to ensure the excellent health of your animal, you should take care of its defecation and vaccination. Usually, annually or every semester it's advisable to have a medical checkup and test its dental care. Routine testing is not a free provision of services, so it is good to know from the very beginning that you have to spend a sum of money to maintain your animal's good health.

###### The animal may become ill and require medical attention.

To adopt a pet also involves caring for it when it gets sick. The work of a pet doctor is not free of charge. Many times the owners visit the small animals' clinic counting on their physician's feelings and sentiment and fail to count in the actual cost of the services provided to them. Medical care, just as it costs for humans, it also costs for animals. The vet will give you the options available for each diagnosis and it's up to the owner to decide how to cope with them. The owner must always remember and provide as much as possible for any costs that his or her animal may need in case of illness.

###### The animal will arrive at some time in the elderly.

Old age often brings along some minor or major health problems. A large percentage of stray animals are elderly animals that either had a poor diagnosis and are ill or have age problems such as incontinence, loss of vision or hearing, bad breath, and general problems that are not an immediate danger to the animal but ""annoy"" the owner. Your pet, just like you, will eventually reach this stage, and will expect you to have the good will to take care of it and to take care of it in the final stages of its life, despite its minor problems, as he can no longer run, does not play or is not able to guard the house as well as he used to in his youth.

###### The animal has a need for natural behavior.

Before you adopt a pet, check out the specific habits and issues of its breed. For some issues, there are solutions, especially if you address them at the very beginning, while others concern the very nature of the animal and you have to learn to live with. In regards to the most prominent pets we all know, namely dogs and cats, you need to know the following: - The dog barks, and the cat meows. It is the normal behavior of the animals and it is absurd to expect the animal to always be silent. There is, of course, the possibility of training the dog to some extent, but not the cat.

By communicating with your animal, you can teach him when he is bothering you, but you should not expect to always be quite at the times you want. As our hair changes, so are the animal's, except that the animal's hair is far easier to spot. This is mostly due to the frequency and amount of hair they have to begin with. You must be prepared to tolerate hair on your home and on your clothes. Frequent cleanliness and especially the use of roll-on adhesive tape can greatly facilitate the issue.

###### Some species of animals require coat care.

Animals with a specific coat (eg long-haired) that are left untreated, tend to experience skin problems or difficulty in their normal self-cleaning, or ingestion of large bristles, the ""hairballs"". You should definitely be aware that your animal will require care either by yourself or by a qualified person.

###### The animal needs companionship.

Do not adopt a pet if it is going to be left alone for the longest period of the day. The animal needs your companion or the companion of a second animal (in this case there is an increase in the cost of care, but it is a very good solution if you want pets but you do not have much time available). You should know that when you return home after a difficult day, you have to devote a little time to your pet (for a dog this time is not simply replenished with the walk).

And at this point, animals again resemble children. You have to think about how to care for your animals when you are going to be away for some time without taking them with you. There is, of course, the option of pet daycare, but also people who can come home and control/care for your animals. The key here is the frequency of the periods that the animals will remain alone, combined with the costs that you will need to incur during these periods. These costs involve pet daycare or a hotel for dogs if you plan to be away for a longer period of time. As for cats, cat care and cat sitting are very common as well, despite them being more independent.

###### The animal needs protection from harsh weather conditions.

Do not adopt a pet if you intend to have it tied somewhere to your garden, rooftop or balcony. Pets need protection from the sun, cold, rain and air, otherwise, they may get sick easily. The small dog's house provided by many owners on the balcony or terrace is simply not enough to protect the animal. Besides, your animal needs social contact, as mentioned before. Staying outside involves isolation and behavioral problems.

###### The animal may cause you a health issue.

Like all species - including humans - the pet can also carry diseases if you do not take good care for its health and proper hygiene. It might also get you injured while playing or if it feels threatened. You must always remember that you have an animal that thinks with instinct and not a person who thinks using logic. If the animal has attacked you, look for the reasons behind. It is normal behavior if the animal is injured or particularly scared, or ... spoiled (and the blame here is yours). If the change of behavior is sudden, you should visit the vet for any neurological or other animal health problems.

With regard to the diseases that the animal can transmit to you, personal hygiene (house cleaning, hand washing, animal toilet cleanliness) and animal health also ensure your own health. The veterinarian knows the diseases that the animal can transmit to you if it is sick and therefore can inform you about the treatment of your animal and your own protection during this period.

Do not trust every article you read, opinions from friends and family or non-experts in regards the subject. When it comes to animal diseases and their transmission to humans, the doctor specialized is the animal physician. No animal should be left stray as a solution to a contagious disease. The solution is to treat, prevent and apply hygiene rules. Obviously, if someone living with you gets hurt (and here you have an imminent risk of transmission), you do not throw him on the road, but you apply the same measures as those proposed for animals.

###### The responsibility of animal reproduction is yours.

Sterilization is a method of controlling the reproduction of companion animals. Also, sterilization is a prevention method for various diseases of domestic animals. However, if you want your animal to remain as is, you must take care of: a) the adoption of the newborn animals by people who are reliable and responsible; b) tolerance when it comes to the natural behavior of the animals that may be disturbing to you and those around you (eg sounds of the female cat, malodorous smells of male animals, change of behavior) and c) safe ""mating"" of the animals in order not to be injured , not to transmit or be transmitted of any disease, and no further increase the population of strays.

###### The responsibility in case of need for the adoption of the animal is yours.

If for some reason you have to give your animal for adoption, it is enforceable under the law to find an owner who will take care of it and provide him with suitable living conditions.

###### Getting informed is the responsibility of the vet but also the owner's responsibility.

Read, get familiar with pet doctors, look for owner experiences, ask about the type of animal, its basic needs, habits, conditions in which it must live, the problems the owner often faces before making the decision to adopt an animal.

Your animal tolerates you. It tolerates sounds, voices, smells, hours, habits (good and bad), irritations, problems, illnesses. Before you decide to adopt a pet, think about whether you are ready to do something about it and if you can give up little of your daily comfort and part of your income to dive into the marvelous experience of owning a pet. The veterinarian is at the disposal of the stakeholders in order to smoothen the differences and propose solutions for the better living of both the animal and the owner.

If you are thinking to adopt a pet but still have questions or doubts, we believe that sharing a pet for a few months can give you great insight and allow you to make an educated decision.

I've been able to crack some of her puzzles (pee walk at exactly 6am, followed immediately by a treat, then a bowl of kibble. Won't eat the kibble if she doesn't get the treat first, etc) because she is a very sharp communicator and will point to things and vocalize if something is out of order.

She refuses to go on long walks, and she will get into a dead weight standoff if we stray too far from her pee spot. I understand long walks stimulate pooping, so maybe figuring out how to get her to go for a long walk may help?

1. He jumps onto our very high guest bed multiple times a day so it is not a pain-caused-by-jumping issue
2. He is a little reluctant to get in the car on the way there but nothing near as bad as this.
3. He loves the car and usually sticks his head out the window the whole time (and he did this both times on the way there), but when driving home from my parents these last two times (at night) he has huddled in the back cargo area like he‚Äôs scared or in pain.

This is a warning for dog owners who use or are considering using Plaque Off for your dog.

&amp;#x200B;

My very healthy, perfectly normal 7 year old Mini Australian Shepard was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism this year, which the vets concluded was thyroid cancer - as hyperthyroidism is EXTREMELY rare in dogs. Because it is such a rare diagnosis, I spent thousands of dollars on multiple specialty vet bills and cat scans, evening having to take off work and travel 3+ hours away to take him to a vet school (no one else in my city would do it because of lack of experience). Turns out, he doesn't have thyroid cancer..... which leaves the vets even more puzzled.

&amp;#x200B;

We started inspected his diet. He eats Hill's Prescription diet, so we started with the only supplement I gave him.... Plaque Off. The vet inspected the ingredients and immediately was concerned over the high levels of Iodine. I stopped giving it to him cold turkey, and his thyroid (T3 &amp;T4) levels started returning to normal almost immediately. The vet concluded after this latest, clean thyroid test that this stuff was the culprit. I had been giving it to him for less than a year.

1421,"I'm worried that my expectations for my puppy influence how I interact with her and that I am pushing her beyond (or maybe under) what she needs. I know that a dog's breed can give a good indication of its traits, but dogs can vary individually within breed standards...especially if you're not 100% sure on your pup's background.

**Background:** My girl, Gumbo, is 4.5 months old (\~19 weeks). We're going with her being a small australian shepherd/miniature american shepherd of some sort, at least until our Embark results come back. I've had her since she was \~10 weeks old. I've personally had a rescue lab/rottweiler mix before who died of old age, but she was both permanently injured from her past owners and honestly a big couch potato who just wanted a good walk around the neighborhood and a yard to nap in. Now that I have the chance to raise a healthy, energetic and social puppy (my first on my own, though raised others as part of my family), I'm realizing I'm putting my idea of what her breed needs in my expectations of our days together rather than being able to read her as an individual pup.

Gumbo is a happy, fearless puppy who loves other people, other dogs, and car rides (because they always end up someplace fun).  We just finished a puppy socialization/play group series and she'll be starting obedience classes when she's about 6 months. I am currently not working and can devote 100% of my time to her and devising enrichment activities for her...which leads me to my problem I think. She gets mental stimulation in varied toys/games/training and physical stimulation with fetch/tug/unstructured and structured walks/dog park outings (while most people are at work)/and hiking trails. I let her nap after being awake (roughly 1.5-2.5 hrs awake, 2-3 hours quiet time in crate) and practice some supervised self-play with toys about 30 mins twice a day. My only worry/complaint is that increasingly often she'll throw her ""I'm tired"" tantrum when I least expect it - such as a 10 minutes into a 20 minute unstructured walk. Or she'll plop down and just...lay on the trail only a quarter of the way through her a 3/4 mile hike around a lake (which she's happily completed a few times before). The tantrums involve her razor baby teeth of blood and ouch - so I personally dislike those the most but know how to handle them. It's when she just kind of lays down and just...doesn't budge for all the treats or love or squirrels in the world that I think I might be pushing her too much too young. 

For reference: I know that if we complete the 3/4 mile hike (in about 45 mins-1.5 hrs depending on sniffing speed) or if she gets her 1 hr (with three 5 minute breaks) of puppy play group in, she's pretty much done for the day except for some standard tug and mental toys.

The problem is, the dog is a bit older (I think he's around ten?) and, since he's never been trained, is a huge troublemaker. He's a purebred English Setter.  He hasn't been neutered. For most of his life he's lived out in the country and spent the majority of the day outside. When we brought him to our house, the first thing he did after sniffing out the new house was pee on the side of our couch. My brother and I carved a doggy door into the garage and set up dog beds for our dogs and showed him how to use it, but no matter how many times we've showed him, all he does is stand at the back door and bark.

&amp;#x200B;

We have a kennel for him inside where he can sleep during the night and he's relatively quiet in there, but I'm just not sure what to do at any other time. The barking will literally go on for hours on end and there's no way we can have him roaming free inside the house at this point because he'll just make a complete mess. He is the kind of dog that has no qualms about pulling food off the table or counter.

1) He's always been an annoying barker, but lately there's been a lot of different vocalizations from growling (not aggressive or at least not directed to anyone), whimpering and howling.

My furbaby is 20 lb and a little too big to fly in the cabin :(
So, to fly him over to the US, which do you think is the better option:
A.  Fly him from Hong Kong to Chicago or Dallas (12-13 hours), meet him there, then drive a car to Atlanta (12-13 hours)(expensive to do it this way, and would need hotel for night most likely)
B. Fly him all the way to Atlanta (meaning he'd have a layover... at least a 24 hour journey door-to-door).
C. Fly him to one of those cities, check on him and even spend the night in a hotel or something with him to give him a break, then fly both of us to Atlanta (2-4 hour flight).

I'm mostly worried about the layover part.  What do you think?  Get it all done in one go or check on him at the first port of entry?

1437,"I‚Äôll establish some ethos here- I‚Äôm a vet tech, and I‚Äôve worked in a few kennels and volunteered at shelters since I was in high school. 
At my last job I worked with a dog trainer who taught me some basics but I‚Äôm by no means a professional (yet. Im very interested in studying canine behavior and eventually becoming a trainer as a profession.)

Im a strong advocate for balanced training. I think for some dogs positive reinforcement works great, but others really do need tools like prongs, e-collars, etc. The breeds I‚Äôve seen in person this working well for were some of the ‚Äòstronger more difficult‚Äô breeds like bullies, or high drive Shepherds/Malinois who will literally ignore positive training techniques. 

Of course you should never rely solely on a prong or an e to keep your dog in check, its about using it to teach and then consistently working towards not needing it. Some people are so freaking quick to shit on these tools though, or call them ‚Äúabusive‚Äù which I don‚Äôt understand because I‚Äôve seen dogs GREATLY benefit from them. As long as they are used properly by someone who knows what they‚Äôre doing they‚Äôre fine. 

Im by no means saying positive training doesn‚Äôt work, The techniques you use depend on what your dog needs and responds best to.

Edit: to clarify I‚Äôm by no means saying that all high drive breeds like GSD/Mals need aversive tools to be trained. I had clients that did dog sports like IPO/Schutzhund and I‚Äôve seen how motivated these dogs are by just the sight of a ball. I said this because these are some of the dogs I saw benefit from aversive tools the most at my job because they‚Äôre so intelligent and learn things very fast. These were specific dogs I worked with who had issues with control and focus during walks/off leash, and in these specific cases positive methods did nothing. 

Edit 2: I don‚Äôt think prongs and e collars are necessarily about punishment (if used right) but more about communication with your dog.","[discussion] Maybe an unpopular opinion, but positive training does not work for every dog.",dogs

Also, I noticed at least 3 piles of poop on their carpet... and their was probably more under the clothing all over the floor. I noticed a smell coming from their room, but I assumed it was just the puppy pads they use occassionally for pee.

I've been working from home a lot the past week since I don't want him to be alone too long.

The first time I meet him he was very friendly with both me and my friend. I came back a week later to pick him up and

he was pretty shy. I thought that maybe it's because he was on medication and didn't question it too much.

Now I notice that he is too anxious with people and other dogs. 

I had a dog walker come by for a meet and greet. We walked around the block with him, then I had them feed him treats for a while, but he would never leave my side and wouldn't let them touch him. We tried to simulate what would happen if I had a dog walker. So I put him in his playpen, then we all exited the apartment. Then the dog walker came in without me, they gave him some treats but the moment they opened the pen he ran and hid in my room. The dog walkers said they can't help me due to how fearful he is, and the same goes for dog day care.

1478,"I adopted a sweet pitbull mix, Blondie, now almost 3 months ago. She's around 2 years old. She came from a foster home with 4 other dogs and apparently got along with all of them great. I've grown very fond of Blondie over the last 3 months, it's me and her at home and we just have a great time.

She's sweet and gentle with humans all the time, a little timid/shying away around children at times but never aggressive. When I first got her, when we walked around the neighborhood she would meet other dogs and be friendly and want to play. As time went on she became less friendly towards them, and then one time kind of attacked a young dog, we had to pull them apart -- it was completely surprising to me, and this was the first time I got concerned. As time has gone on since then she has become more and more aggressive towards dogs, and now growls at almost every passing dog in a very non-playful manner, barks at some. Now I don't let her interact with other dogs on leash and we cross the street to avoid them.

The dog walker that I've had since the beginning takes her to the dog park, and at the park (which I understand is a very different environment than being on leash) she has a great time playing. As the dog walker has reported this whole time, her only problem is sometimes overenthusiastic play. However, today the dog walker reports that she sort of attacked another dog, and latched on to the dog's throat and wouldn't let go until the humans separated them. They were all fine but obviously now I'm very concerned, as seems to be the dog walker who was there.

It's not at all clear what triggered her. I'm sad but OK with the idea of not letting her interact with other dogs except on playdates and very controlled settings, if that.

However, my true concern is that I spend a lot of time with my family who live nearby and my youngest sibling is only 8 years old. I find myself wondering, since I don't know what's setting her off, whether it's possible she could bite a human the way she bit a dog today.

She has shown zero aggression towards humans in the past 3 months. Maybe she has become a tiny bit less friendly, in the sense that she's less enthusiastic about being pet by every passing stranger in the street than she was originally.

But I'm scared now, for my little sister, and I want to know if it's unreasonable or not.","[Help] Adopted a pitbull mix 3 months ago. She's been set off a couple times, I'm concerned.",dogs
1479,"[This is Clover :) ](https://imgur.com/a/1xV02Dq)

Clover is an 8mo rescue we have had since she was 8 weeks old. We were told she is a lab mix but I definitely think she has some border collie in her based on appearance and behavior. She has a sweet and friendly temperament although is super high energy. We are currently in beginning obedience classes, which seem to be going fairly well. However, I am looking for some advice about a couple behaviors. And what her breed may be also - is there some shepherd in her? 

1. She definitely obeys my commands (for the most part) but totally disregards my 7 &amp; 9 year old children. She does not jump on or nip at me, but displays extreme herding behavior with them. How can I ‚Äúnip‚Äù this and have her show them more respect? (Pun intended haha) 

2. Jumping - I‚Äôve done some online research and tried a few techniques but with my kids and visitors she will not calm down without being placed outside or in her crate for a short period of time. She gets SUPER excited and sometimes it is even hard for me to bring her outside or to her crate. Does this behavior decrease with age? 

3. I currently work from home and am able to exercise and play with her most of the day. Within the next year or so I may be moving to be closer to my office and will have to have her in the crate while I am working. I am afraid this will cause some issues with both separation anxiety (since she is used to being home with me all day) and having tons of pent up energy. Any ideas on how to mitigate these effects? 

4. I also own a cat and Clover loves to ‚Äúplay‚Äù with her - my cat generally tolerates this but sometimes Clover will fixate on her and be relentless. My cat has the ability to get away and is not declawed but I do feel bad for her sometimes. My cat generally stays in a different area of the house, and seems to enjoy ‚Äúplaying‚Äù with Clover sometimes even though she growls and bars at her (this doesn‚Äôt sound like it makes sense but if you saw it in person you would understand). Any ideas on how to get Clover to stop the fixation and just coexist peacefully? ;)

1493,"I am new to this sub so thank you in advance for reading my thread.  I've been reviewing similar threads but wanted to post my situation for all of your helpful thoughts.

My wife and I have an amazing 10.5 year old rare breed bulldog (Alaphaha Blueblood).  He has been fixed and is 75 lbs. He has been our best friend, amazingly loyal, and been through a lot with us.  He is a total people person, loves being a part of the family, and enjoys meeting new people of all ages.   Friends in the neighborhood would bring their children to play with him since he was so gentle. He has been hit or miss interacting with other dogs throughout his life.  

We also have a 15month old son.  For the first year, he was fine with our son and there was a lot of opportunity for bad things to happen as they played together.

About 4 months ago, while we were all playing together, our dog started growling and lunged at the baby.  It was quite scary but there was no harm.  From that moment we decided to keep a really close eye on things and hoping it was an isolated incident as the baby was playing with a toy that was previously the dogs (a football that the dog kicked once and never touched again).  A similar situation happened about a month later, again no harm no foul but we decided to keep them separated at all times going forward.  

Last week, while Grandma was watching the baby something happened (details are sketchy and not completely forthcoming from 78yr old Grandma who feels absolutely terrible about the whole situation) where the dog went after the baby and scratched up our son's face.  It obviously wasn't a great situation but it could have been much, much worse.  

In addition, he has gotten \*extremely\* aggressive with every dog he comes across.  We have to be very careful when we walk him and take him places, which is getting fewer and farther between since we can't bring them both anywhere together.  

His behavior seems to have changed as well where he would sleep in our bedroom everynight without fail.  Now he sleeps in random places and will often walk off by himself which is completely against his desire to want to be around people.  These behavior changes are inexplicable. 

We took the him to the vet and preliminary report is that he is fine.  I would have bet money that something was wrong with him based on the recent behavior changes. The vet had to recommend that we put the dog down as we have a small child in the house.  Obviously we want to do the right thing but this is an extremely difficult decision for us.  My parents who are older would have taken the dog to live with them but now my mother is very scared of the dog which is probably an overreaction but understandable. Our house is big enough that we could keep them both physically separated but I'm not sold on how fair this would be for the dog and there is always a chance for bad things to happen as our son learns to open doors and gates.

So I have been looking for a young adult dog for a while, and for various reasons I'm looking at breeders of rough/smooth collies. There's one breeder in particular I'm very fond of - I've visited her kennels and her dogs are all so happy, well-adjusted and healthy. She raises dogs for service work so temperament is very important to her. She asked me today if I'd consider co-ownership of one of her 2 year old girls that has the personality traits we're looking for. She thinks she's a delightful dog, and her sibling is in service work, but she didn't put as much training into this girl, so she lags behind the stage in service work training that her sibling is at. She still thinks she has the temperament/health to be an excellent mother to a litter. What the breeder proposed is that I own this dog with her, and for about 2 months next summer, she goes to live in the kennel and raise a litter, then we get her back.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, has anyone else heard of or done this kind of thing? It's new territory for me. I imagine we would have some kind of contract, with a stipulation of when the breeding is done and ownership would be fully transferred to me? I plan on discussing this more with her in a week when I go to visit again, just wanted to get some perspective from people who have maybe have more experience than me.

I am all for picking up your dog's poop. I am all for poop bag stands and signs that remind you to pick up after your dog. I'm even all for giving poop bags to strangers to encourage them to pick up their poop (if done politely)

However, I'm really fucking annoyed by people freaking out when they witness a piece of shit being left behind by a fellow dog owner. I get it--dog poop is gross and we want our public areas to look nice and it's also bad for the environment. But demonizing people over poop bags is really weird to me.

My neighbors regularly send angry group emails about poop not being picked up. All caps rants, PHOTOGRAPHS of people accused of not picking up poop, and what is essentially public shaming. Same thing happens on facebook. I have been chased down, screamed at, and accused of this vile offense on two occasions by two different people. Both times, the poop in question did not come from my dog. But even if it had, is this an appropriate reaction?

I've developed anxiety on walks and I've legit had nightmares about forgetting poop bags. I once saw a lady frantically searching her bag and then she called out to me, distressed, saying she forgot poop bags but she promised she was going to run home and get them and come back. She also apologized profusely to me

Over. Dog. Poop.

I just think we should all try to keep things in perspective when it comes to dog poop. Live on the edge--next time you see someone forget a bag or neglect to pick up after their dog, refrain from posting an angry rant or shaming them on social media. Take a deep breath, pick up the poop yourself, and keep walking

**Edit: To clarify, I am not saying that picking up after your dog is not your responsibility. It is. I am saying that I disagree with how some people choose to react when someone does not pick up poop. I made the post because the public shaming and accusations are becoming socially acceptable and seem to be increasing in frequency (at least in my experience). It's annoying.

1505,"So, I have a Corgi. He‚Äôs 8-months old (neutered already if it matters) and has the normal non-stop barking behavior we knew to expect when we first got him.

Now, he‚Äôs a great dog and he‚Äôs pretty well trained thanks to my wife‚Äôs doing. Given Corgi‚Äôs reputation he‚Äôs probably not the worst barker, but there are days where it‚Äôs a little overbearing. 

Basically, I just want to know if the behavior and frequency of barking is a lifelong thing or will he calm a little bit down as he gets older? Any advice on Corgi‚Äôs online focuses on puppies, but rarely talks about how they are once they‚Äôre pass the puppy stage.

As someone who‚Äôs owned multiple dogs (and puppies), puppies vs grown adults dogs are usually huge differences if decently trained.

1507,"So I'm a first time dog owner, and about 3 weeks ago I adopted my first dog, a year old lab mix. I never grew up with dogs but I've always wanted one so I thought I'd give it a shot. Kiwi is a very sweet boy, loves to cuddle, and is already housebroken!


Unfortunately I work all day and live in an apartment, so this is typically our daily routine: 

- walk him at about 7:30 am before I leave for work

- I hire a Wag! walker to take him for a short walk (20 min) at noon

- When I get home we immediately go to the dog park for an hour

- When we get home I do about 20 minutes of training (positive reinforcement only with a clicker, we're just starting beginner Pet Smart training!)

- He cuddles with me or generally follows me around while I'm home

- I take him for another short walk ~10 before bed, then he sleeps with me on his bed next to mine

- On weekends I try to go for a 2 hour hike/walk with him one a day, otherwise its a similar routine.

I'm feeding him Blue Buffalo ""Wild"" kibble, 4 cups a day (he's about 75 pounds), and I haven't had many behavioral problems with him, except he gets a little jumpy when meeting new people (friendly jumping, no growling or aggression I think?)

The only problem I've had is at the dog park: he's generally friendly and playful, no other dog owner has said anything to me saying that he plays too rough, except once in a while he'll find one dog that he just can't help himself from humping (he's neutered and up to date on vaccinations, plus I'm getting pet insurance for him). I'm always within 3 feet of him at the park so whenever he starts humping I immediately pull him off, and if he tries to do it again I usually just leave the park for the day.

Is there anything I'm doing wrong? Is there anything else I should be doing? If there's anything I'm doing that's wrong please tell me!

1509,"SO SORRY FOR THE NASTY TOPIC IN ADVANCE BUT I JUST WANT TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE HAS SOME HOLISTIC WISDOM TO SHARE!!

My 7 year old terrier mix has had sensitivity problems her entire life - sensitive skin, bad allergies, sensitive paws, and a very sensitive digestive system. Any little thing out of the ordinary when she was a puppy would give her the runs for two weeks straight. I have had her on a probiotic on and off pretty consistently her entire life to help with this as well as various medicines/supplements for her skin and allergies. I‚Äôve dealt with her multitude of problems for so long now and invested so much money in vet trips etc that I consider myself pretty seasoned in the dog allergy realm.

I have her on a mixture of blue buffalo dry food and 2 tbsp of science diet sensitive skin/stomach wet food. I swapped her wet food from natural balance limited ingredient wet food about a month ago thinking it would further help with her skin. She gets a really red inflamed stomach during summer months and being in Texas it can get really bad so I thought any additional line of defense couldn‚Äôt hurt.

I work long hours every week and don‚Äôt normally take the dogs out and monitor their BMs as they‚Äôve been house trained for a very long time now and have a doggie door so they can let themselves out whenever they need to go. I finally did pooped scooper duty last weekend after probably 2 months of not touching it (I know I should do it more often I work really long hours and live by myself so it‚Äôs hard to get to everything pls don‚Äôt judge me) and noticed her poops have been taking on more of a cow-patty consistency rather than firm logs like they should be.

Color is normal, it‚Äôs definitely not explosive diarrhea, but still very soft compared to a normal healthy poop. My other dog who is literally invincible to everything has healthy, solid poops on the same diet. 

Since noticing her poops in the yard I‚Äôve been trying to go out with her more often to see if it is still going on and it seems to be every time she goes. Because I haven‚Äôt scooped the yard in so long idk if the soft poops have been going on since before I switched the food or not. I know I need to either adjust her diet or add something to her diet to help but don‚Äôt know where to start because of all the variables.

If anyone knows of any holistic suggestions or remedies that will be the least disruptive to our routine it would be greatly appreciated! Definitely don‚Äôt want to take her to the vet if it‚Äôs not needed and absolutely cannot take her off of the blue buffalo as I have previously as she broke out in hives all over her body.

I wanted to avoid looping one wire back along itself, so instead I ran one wire out to one end of the chain link fence and another wire out to the other end of the chain link fence.

1512,"Hi everyone! I rescued an amazing border collie (spaniel??) mix about 2 months ago. She is incredibly well behaved and has become quite bonded to me. 

The problem I‚Äôm running into now, is that she barks when she hears ANYTHING outside. This is not usually a full bark like she is excited, more of a half bark w some warning growls to the outside noise. This gets worse at night bc it is quiet and any movement will cause her to alert me (usually scaring the poop out of me in a dead sleep). I am totally fine with her barking when someone is near the front door or right outside my apartment window (I‚Äôm on the ground floor) as I appreciate the security she provides. She is not barking compulsively, quiets down pretty quickly once I start petting her and saying ‚Äúshhh it‚Äôs okay‚Äù, but it is quite clear she wants to protect herself and I. She is a vocal dog in general, not always barking but usually whining or howling to get attention or communicate that she needs to go potty. 

There is a large communal yard outside my unit/window, and the problem is she will do these ‚Äútiny woofs‚Äù and huffs as I call it if someone is even out on the yard outside, 20+ ft from my window. This includes other people walking to their apartment units, the security guard who walks around at night, people taking their dogs out in the early am before work etc. Things that to me, are no threat and I do not need to be jolted awake at 5am for. How do I teach her to differentiate between people coming and going, and actual threats or at least people too close to my apartment unit? She is quick to learn, I‚Äôm just not sure how to go about training her. 

She usually sleeps on my bed with me, right against this window. I do kennel train her and she never barks if I have her sleep in there (likely bc it is in a room further from the window). Like I said, I don‚Äôt mind her alerting me if someone is right outside the door/window but would like to make it clear that is the only time I need alerting.

1514,"My dog is a Border-Collie mix, shes roughly 18 months old. She has high anxiety issues. 

When we received her from a co worker they withheld information on her having high anxiety issues. I myself have social anxiety. Since we got this dog though, my anxiety is worse. Before we had her, I could leave the house and get out with our toddler on walks and expose myself to my fears to help lower the anxiety, but for the past 7 months, since we got dog. I havnt been able to go places much. And it's effecting me. 

We can't take her with us because she gets car sick and pukes and is afraid of everything and runs. We can't leave her without kenneling her because she destroys the house. 

Left her alone for a hour and half the first time we had to leave her alone and she found ways to climb on our counters pull curtains, chew couch, floor, eat croyons and she pooped all over the place and puked. And while in kennel, she still manages to find ways to ruin things or she will pee and poop and puke. Even when gone for a drs apointment less then an hr.

 We have tried a lot of things to help her. Tried medications over the counter stuff and vet reccomened stuff. Have tried to drain her energy before we leave and her anxiety just takes over and she goes crazy.

 She doesn't bite unless shes trying to play (which we are trying to teach her that hands are not toys) but she thinks shes going to be hit when we try to train her to sit or stay, she doesn't like any voice of authority, and she cowers around strangers. 

She barks when shes left in her kennel, we have caught her doing it before leaving and neighbors have spoken about it. She whines 24/7 when not asleep, shes physically perfect, her weight ,height, health, all good besides anxiety. 

We take her to my mom's on weekends so she has a wide space to run with my moms dogs (we have to use a old sheet to cover the whole backseat because she pukes and won't sit or lay down while in car). We love her but we cannot afford to get a professional to train her, and I'm not sure I can handle her anymore. 

It has me crying because I can't stand the thought of doing that to her. I grew up with a lot of animals taken from me. Our 2 cats we have had since they were kittens and they are 12years old now. We wanted a dog, and had asked questions when we got her, but we didn't know anything about her issues until she was already ours. We were looking for a dog that was already potty trained and good with kids and cats and that wouldn't make things this hard. 

But my life and my toddlers life is very limited, my toddler has only been to a park twice. And that was before we got the dog. Toddler has extra needs of therapy help with developmental delay and physical therapy. And it's just not good to be shut ins because I feel I can't leave my own house becouse dog will lose it.

1517,"So I take my year and half old Mastiff/Rottie mutt (adopted about 3 months ago) to the dog park every day, and 75% of the time he has absolutely no problem. He is very friendly and playful and loves being chased and chasing when he finds another dog to do it with, or he just walks around calmly sniffing. The other 25%, he finds one dog that he absolutely needs to hump. It's almost immediately after he sees him, they don't play first, he just immediately goes to hump.

I'm a bit of a helicopter dog dad so I'm always 3 feet away from him so when he starts, I immediately pull him off, and put him in a sit and watch. If he goes for it again, I just usually leave the dog park.

I've only been using positive reinforcement for training, and he's got a pretty solid recall when he's not going to town on some other dog (he's only off-leash in the park or at home though). Since I'm pretty on top of it he hasn't gotten into any trouble because of the humping, and the other dog owners are generally pretty cool with it, I'm just worried that some dog is really not going to like it and they're going to get into a fight.

Some more information on his behavior at the park: he likes to be the party police when other dogs are playing rough. When two dogs are really going at it, he tends to run up to them and bark at them like crazy until one of them starts playing with him instead. He never seems ""aggressive"" when he does this, but if this is a sign of a larger problem let me know.

Like I said I've only been using clicker-positive reinforcement training with him, so I'm a little unsure how to get him to stop. When I ask other dog owners at the park, they say that they would just grab him by the collar and shove him down because it's a dominance issue, but 1: I don't believe in dominance theory and 2: I don't want to be abusive to my dog :/

And ideas would be greatly appreciated or if you think you need more information! This is literally the only behavioral problem we have with him, he was a shelter school dog dropout (we don't know the reason) and he a very quick learner.

1519,"My dog is 7 years old now, and we've been fighting allergies for nearly 2 years. When we moved to our current home, she started having issues that we attributed to her new collar, as it first presented as a rash/pungent discharge from the neck area, then moved to a bad ear infection, then severe hair loss (&gt;50%). Her constant chewing/licking has also led to her exposed skin looking rough. We've visited the veterinarian, which hinted towards a possible food allergy. We tried different foods, but got no success. At this point, due to the correlation between the move and the onset of symptoms, we think it may be a grass pollen allergy. She hasn't worn a collar since about a month or so after this started. 

Over this time, we've tried washing her with medicated shampoo, keeping her ears clean and using medications, giving her antihistamines, and anything else we can consider. However, at this point, she's missing so much hair, can't stop licking/chewing (to the point of saturating the carpet with saliva), and she seems to be in constant discomfort/pain (constant whining and no interest in activity). I hate to say it and feel badly for doing so, but we're starting to consider putting her down since we can't seem to get a handle on it and her discomfort. I just don't know how reasonable it would be to expect an improvement in her quality of life at this point. 

Has anyone experienced this, or does anyone have any idea what may help in this case? I understand that this is not a replacement for medical advice, but medical advice hasn't seemed to give us much. I couldn't care less how she looks, as I'm aware the hair loss is very likely permanent, but is there any hope for recovery at this point, or are our thoughts of a humane end to this justified?

1522,"This is a little long but I need some help. Just over a week ago, my boyfriend and I adopted a heart worm positive weimaraner/lab mix from the shelter, Bullet. We already had an almost 8 year old male weimaraner (Diesel). Bullet has been the sweetest boy and the dogs have gotten better together each day...until last night when the Bullet (vet guessed between 6 mos to a year) got aggressive with the Diesel a couple times. Unprovoked, he lunged out at Diesel with my boyfriend and I watching.

We introduced them multiple times on neutral ground before making the decision, and I reached out the woman who had fostered Bullet to ask questions, and she told me that he had been amazing with her dogs, and actually worked to keep fighting dogs apart. The shelter said he played great with other dogs of each gender, and had no history of aggression with any other dogs. I know that two males can have issues, but I really thought I had covered my bases to pick a dog that would get along with our Diesel.

But now that he is feeling comfortable at home, the aggression toward Diesel is coming out. No blood has been drawn, but I really don't want that to happen.

He is intact because the vet preferred to wait until he was heart worm negative to put him under anesthesia. I called to ask about the possibility of neutering him earlier, and she said that we could but that she was not certain it would help. Her suggestion to me was that we return him to the shelter. She said she has seen way too many dogs in for injuries due to fighting at home.

I am absolutely heartbroken. I do not want to return him to the shelter. But I also do not want to keep either of them in a situation that could end dangerously. I am feeling sick to my stomach over this. I never thought to get rid of him; I hoped that getting him fixed earlier would help, but when the vet suggested returning him, my stomach dropped.

It's gotten to the point that I can't focus, concentrate or get work done and I find myself snapping at her frequently as my nerves are shot from the constant whining. I've ruled out physical or medical issues with the vet. The pup is by nature high strung, anxious and nosey, and whining has been a problem her whole life, but has been getting worse and has gotten to an almost unbearable level for me now. I have anxiety which I mostly have under control but my dog whining is really getting to me and I wish I had a better way to manage my reaction. I'm not sure if I should focus on my reaction or helping to calm her. I'm also trying to work full time so I don't have endless hours to occupy the dog. I know ""going away"" is the most common recommendation but my house is so small (360sf studio) there is no where for me to go.

We live on a piece of property with other people and I keep her in the house with me unless she can be supervised out in the yard or unless I have her on a walk. She whines at a high level if other people are in the yard, if she sees a cat or other animal outside, if garbage trucks drive up, if another dog walks by outside the fence, or if there's anything she wants to be doing -- mainly going outside for various reasons. She can't be trusted outside in the yard on her own so I keep her with me unless I can physically be with her outside. Many days she also whines at a low level more or less constantly. It's less interrupting than the frantic whining she does when she wants to go outside but I still can't focus and she is clearly not happy which makes me sad.

She is exercised at least twice a day with bike rides, walks, sniff walks, and yard games, and when my husband is home and can supervise her in the yard, she does get to hang out in the yard for a couple hours a day (which is what she truly wants to be able to do).

1526,"To make my traumatizing backstory as short and painless as possible, my hubby and I had a rescue. We had him from about 6 months old, until the incident about 6 years later. He was a high-energy black lab/hound/spaniel mix of some sort that was about 40-45 pounds. He had some trust issues with children that we were working on, but had NEVER shown any sort of aggression towards a child. On my daughter's 1st birthday he pinned her to the floor and went after her face. Trying to punch him in the face to get him off her is something I'll never get from my brain. Even typing that made my heart sink, and my daughter had to be in surgery for 2.5 hours. Luckily she'll have no permanent damage and her scars are mostly faded. As a result of the severity of the attack, we had to put our previously loving dog down. It was a family tragedy that we're finally recovering from almost a year and a half later. 

Anyway, the point i'm getting to is that we're finally considering getting a dog again. I've always had dogs and i've worked in doggy daycare, so i'd say our experience with dogs is pretty high. Our daughter is enamored with dogs (thank god she isn't afraid) and there's a good chance that she'll be an only child and I want her to have that companionship. 

So all that being said, here's the things that matter to us as far as what we're looking for:

Must be from a breeder. I've always been about rescues, but after what happened i'm hesitant to get a dog without a thorough knowledge of its past.

Temperament: as friendly and tolerant as possible. This is the most important part. We work with our daughter all the time on ""nice pets"", but she is still a toddler. 

Size: 20-40 pounds. I love large dogs, (i've always wanted a newfie) but after my experience, I want something a bit more manageable in case of an emergency. 

Energy level: our previous dog was seriously the most energetic dog i've ever met. I'm ok with high energy and we're an active family with a sizable yard and a dog park nearby. Exercising a dog 95% of days wouldn't be a problem for us.

Training: my hubby and I are both willing to work on training, or even take the dog to training. Our previous dog was my hubby's self-proclaimed best friend and I really think that would be a bonding experience he would relish. 

Special considerations: we have 2 cats. Also we both work full time, but most days the dog will get let out on lunch. Also our previous dog was black and due to the trauma of the experience, i'd prefer any other coloration.

Gus' previous owners are good friends of ours and he is well trained and behaved (for the most part). Although they love Gus, they are looking to move, and plan on eventually having children (apparently Gus is not great with kids, which is fine by us as we have no intentions of having children). That and they have decided that two GS dogs in the household is just too much. That being said, the couple said they will gladly take Gus back should he turn out to be an ill-suited fit. They care immensely about Gus and want to find him the proper home.

Gus grew up with the husband of the couple and when they eventually moved in together the wife brought along Gus' mom (the couple met when the husband decided to purchase Gus from the litter). Gus apparently took some time in getting used to the wife (about 2 months or so, in her recollection) occasionally showing teeth, light barking (I think), but never full blown biting. The couple lived in the suburbs with a big fenced yard, and so Gus had quite a lot of space to roam and run. My wife and I live in the city and although we have a yard it is not fenced (yet), nor is it expansive. Gus has apparently not been leashed (for walks yes, but not in an outdoor, free to ""roam"" scenario) and is skittish when he hears the line dragging behind him. From what I understand, Gus was predominantly an outdoor dog and although his crate was indoors (garage), he was rarely let into the house.

One of my main concerns is Gus adapting to being an inside dog. My wife and I both work although currently our schedules are split. I work Wednesday through Sunday and she works Monday through Friday. This means that Gus will invariably be left inside and alone 3 days of the week. We are committed to walking him once in the morning before work on those days and obviously a walk and yard time after work. On to Gus.

He has a crate that he is very comfortable with, although I have been going back and forth on whether I want to try phase it out. He shows some barrier aggression when we initially approaches the crate. He will bark and bare teeth, however this seems to be culled by a stern ""No."" He lunged at my wife when she was putting him up for the night (already inside the crate with a closed door), giving her quite a scare. After the ""No."" he calms down (submissively) and I know that the fear driven habit breaking is not the way to go. We have started following a guide online which suggests slowly approaching the crate while giving words of encouragement and happy faces/noises, armed with treats. As soon as we see him tense, we stop, turn, retreat and try again in two minutes. As of this morning, it didn't take but one turn to get to feed him the treat. Afterwards he is calm enough for us to open the crate, at which point he is a excited bundle of energy, tail wagging and... searching for me.

Which leads me to my next concern. His association with me. We picked him up on a Sunday evening and so naturally, I was home alone with him for all of Saturday, and today. Gus and I get along just fine. He follows me around the house endlessly however has been great with the ""stay"" command, often allowing me to leave the room. He does end up making his way back to my vicinity. He has shown his teeth to me, rarely, and there is definitely some tension surrounding his toys (resource aggression?). I'm trying to get him to learn ""drop"", but will invariable have to grab the toy from his mouth, queue teeth baring (I think I should look more into teaching the drop command, I'm sure taking the toy from the mouth is not the way to go). It dawned on me today that he is fairly familiar with ""leave-it"" which will allow me to approach, and sometimes take his toy.

He is sensitive about his neck naturally, like when I need to put on his pinch collar for walks (definitely will be phasing that out eventually), and also his rear legs for some reason (although the previous vet visit gave a clean bill of health). Oh and mildly so with the feeding. Recently I have been using the stern ""No."" and he seems to recognize that I am referring to his teeth showing, once again turning submissive. With the toys, I don't give the ""No."" rather, turn, pause and walk off.

With my wife, it's a little more often that she will get the teeth, (note: never growling, just a slight lip raise), and similarly he seems to stop when she issues a ""No."" Clipping his collar for instance, or sometimes when simply petting his head. I have picked up on some of the ques leading to this, often times a slight stiffening or tensing but could use advice on how to navigate that. I know it is still very early on in our trial period with Gus, but he seems much more keen to stay near me.

He will follow my wife's commands quite often, either with or without me in the room, especially when there is a treat involved. Things such as sit, stay, come, down, etc. He is relatively well trained! However there is sometimes a reluctance, or even a refusal to follow either of our commands all the time. I am half inclined to relinquish all commands, feeding, leading walks, etc. to the wife when she gets home from work tonight. Also, tomorrow she will be working from home, which I am mildly nervous about, although I think she will be just fine with him. This past day and a half has shown that Gus is a very sweet, loving, want-to-please type so commonly found in GSDs.

If you have made it this far you have my PROFOUND thanks! I know this was quite a long read and ANY insight you can offer will be immensely appreciated. At the end of it all I want what is best for me, my wife, and Gus! Thanks again!

Since then, her sister keeps trying to attack her (we've had 0 issues with them trying to seriously attack each other before) while the one who went outside is cowering away from her sister. We can calm her sister down and she acts totally normal while we do our usual calming steps, but as soon as we let them back together she tries to attack her sister again.

1541,"Help me out, r/dogs. I've been reading this sub for months gearing up to add a four-legged friend to our family. This isn't about breed; we're 99.999% sure we will get a rescue from somewhere. We don't want a puppy. For background: my spouse and I are married, in our 40s. I grew up with dogs (mostly goldens.) My spouse had a rescue lab mix when I met him 20+ years ago who was a major part of our lives and lived to be almost 19 (crazy for a lab mix!) That was 10 years ago. We have not been ready to welcome a pet back into our lives until now. We have two kids, ages 13 and 9, who are SUPER excited for a pet and who get along great with animals. We own our own single family home in a pleasant suburb with a fenced in yard. We are interested in smaller dogs, around 20-40 pounds, preferable chill dogs who like to cuddle. Cuddles are high priority. I should also add that we are strongly considering a cat or cats as well, possible instead of a dog or in addition to a dog or dogs.

&amp;#x200B;

My most recent pet experience was in fact 10 years ago and with a senior dog, so our lifestyle of  two working parents worked out just fine. Our dog was old and lazy and super chill. But now that means I barely remember how to go about welcoming a new dog! 

&amp;#x200B;

So, like I said. We both work full time. My kids are in school. The most time the dog would spend alone is about from 8:15 am to about 3pm, when my teenager gets home from school. We can get a dog walker if we have to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering a couple of things:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Do we need to take time off work to help the dog acclimate to our home? Or is it possible we'll get a rescue who's used to living with fosters or other families and will be fine? It is even remotely possible to get the dog on a Saturday and go back to work on Monday? I know this is weird but like I said I haven't gotten a new dog in a loooong time. If we do need to take time off, how much? I just started a new job and have hardly any vacation time.

&amp;#x200B;

2) We had been thinking of getting a bonded pair of doggos so they have someone to hang out with and keep themselves entertained. Is this a crazy idea? Would this be risky? I have read in some places that bonded pairs then tend to bond less with their humans.

I also would be able to bring the dog with me to my place of work Monday to Friday so plenty of human interaction and things going on.

I‚Äôve done a bit of reading and try to leave her in her crate for a while to calm down and take her straight outside when I get home (max 5hrs in crate, usually 2hrs here or there depending on roommate schedule), look away from her when she does it, etc.  

That‚Äôs been pretty good at solving the excited peeing (still not ideal for her not to wait) but then the submissive pee comes up. I try to ignore her so she doesn‚Äôt get too excited and pee but then sometimes she thinks I‚Äôm mad at her and will submissive pee.

But I realized that can't be the case with the dog he is jealous of being outside, him inside, and all the other two dogs sound asleep (he has no quarrel with them), but he still has a problem.

Being very big and having a two layered coat, I suspect that he is unhappy with where he has chosen to lay. For example, he lays on the couch, growls to himself softly a few times, then gets up in an irritated huff, and goes to lay on the cool floor. Not five minutes later, he is growling again to himself and goes to lay where he was on the couch again. He was not panting in any of his positions.

His elbows are a bit scuffed up as many big dogs get, so I recently purchased a cool mat so he can lay on the tile and not scuff up his elbows, but he never lays on it for long. After his moving around a bit, I had him lay on it, but it wasn't what he wanted either, and he moved back to the couch again. I've also tried pointing a fan at him and he's grown to accept one fan on its softest setting, but even then never for very long.

Mum was the one who really wanted the pup and was totally up for it however in the past few days she's turned to almost hating the little thing. She has limited mobility and due to other health issues she tends to get tired out quite quick. Initially we didn't think this would be an issue as there are 3 other sets of hands to help but as we're out for work/school/college she didn't have a great time of it on her own. To add on top of this dad is out very early to work and the extra work in the morning isn't doing him any favours. I've already heard 'excuses' as to why it was a bad idea (wrong time of year for dog, not enough time etc.) but these didn't seem to be an issue beforehand. Hindsight i guess?

&amp;#x200B;

We (...ish) are seriously considering returning her to the breeder. She's a lovely pup and personally i have wanted a dog again for a few years now however i'm so conscious of how my parents will cope. My brother and i have been helping as much as we can but there's only so much we can do. I want to give her a chance, however... in the long run i'm not sure how or if my parents will cope considering they will be the main carers.

1559,I never knew how big the problem was until I started walking the paths (with my pup/dog) until recently. I was of the opinion that there is far less dog poop than when I was a kid in the 80's and while I still agree that is true the walking paths and off leash areas where I live have a ridiculous amount of poop on or near them. I didn't realise that until I fathered a dog. I believe rangers (or whatever body is responsible for such things in your area) should be allowed to ask dog walkers if they have bags and if they don't they get a fine. I know people sometimes forget bags but no one ever forgets to put a seat belt on their child. Fines for not carrying bags eliminates the need for people to be caught in the act of having their dog poop. I see the problem as clear and the answer as simple. ,[Discussion] My opinion on how the problem of dog poop should be addressed.,dogs
1560,"So I grew up with two female labs - they were both quite dominant and never allowed another dog to mount them (they would twist around and snarl). One was spayed before her first heat, the second well after, so I‚Äôm not sure whether this has an impact.

Now I have a nine month old female German Shepherd / Anatolian Shepherd / mutt mix, and we are choosing to wait to spay her until after her first heat due to the supposed benefits. That having been said, many intact males still try to mount her (from front, side and back), specifically after they have been playing. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just play mounting or dominance mounting or what.

My girl seems relatively submissive in that she will try to get away at first and after a while lay down on her back (I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs doing this to make it harder for them?), but I‚Äôve had to pull her away from males because the other owner didn‚Äôt really care. I wish she would be a bit more feisty about getting them to back off.

1561,"I am hoping to keep this short, I am sorry in advance if it isn't!

So after many years of childhood petless we decided to get a little pup about 2 years ago. Boy, I love him so much. We all did; and we took him to puppy school and trained him to sit and lie down. We also trained him to 'go potty' and he went out his dog door to the little patch of grass that was his toilet. He was a very good boy.

However, now he is increasingly frustrating our whole family. It's like he is going through adolescence or something. He no longer listens to us unless we have a treat, but unfortunately we don't have a treat on us 24/7 and I'd really appreciate if he listened to us without the treat occasionally. And when we do have a treat he just sits without us saying anything and no longer responds to his sit command without a treat (I hope that makes sense). 

When we first got him we had him stay in a crate overnight, we did what everyone said and made it a place to be excited to be in with all these treats and toys. But for six straight months he would not stop barking/crying/scratching. So for our own sanity we caved and let him sleep out in the living room in his bed. This was alright for a bit, but then he started sleeping on the fabric couch which was a big no from mum. As a result, we now flip all the bottom cushions so he can't sleep there. Letting him have free roam has only happened within the last few months. Sometimes he still cries and whinges at the bottom of the steps and scratches the baby gate. I see how this is our fault for letting him 'be boss' but nothing was working and my parents were getting ready to kick him out (they love him too much in all honesty though). 

All of a sudden he starts doing poos inside and all along the pavement outside - pretty much everywhere BUT his designated toilet. This was extremely frustrating because he knows where to go and has done it for the first year and a bit of him being with us. 

Additionally, he can't stand it if he can see us but not be with us. During the day when no one is home he is pretty good at not barking or crying. But if he knows we are inside he will bark and scratch the flyscreen door. He has ruined the door. I believe this is related to the crying at night in the crate. I am assuming separation anxiety? 

finally, he will not allow us to brush or groom him and will run away when we try to catch him. We brushed him regularly as a pup to get him used to the brush and had him groomed by 'professionals'. But now he will run away as soon as we get out the brush and when we try to groom him (we wanted to do it ourselves to save money) he flinches and moves around and tries to bite. I wish he knew we were trying to do the best for him. Now he is severely matted. 

I am pretty sure I included everything I wanted to. If not I'll just add more later. I would really appreciate all of your help!! I love him so much and want the best for him but it's just really hard when he is being like this.

TL;DR / Questions
- He was a very good boy, potty trained etc
- after 2 years is extremely frustrating and disobedient.
- How do I get it back to me being the boss over him?
- My mum wants to try and give him Lovan as she reckons it would help with grooming him, I'm not sure how good this is but I know dogs can have it, is this a bad idea?
- I really just want the best for him but I also want my family to be happy to have him and not feel like he is a burden.",[Help] Starting to get more and more frustrated at my dog (but he's still cute),dogs

1566,"Greetings,

This is my first post in this group as I am in dire need of help. I will try to simplify this post with bullets to address the situation.

-Purchased dog from breeder when she was 2 months old

-1 week into having her, she got parvo, person I bought from took her to known clinic in Mexico for treatment, she is cured.

-started showing signs of aggression towards touching food. The moment she came home from hospital.

-always timid but wasn‚Äôt impossible to deal with.

- have attempted to potty train many times and cannot succeed. She is too afraid to go outside.  Treats do no work. 

-hides under furniture when she knows it‚Äôs time to go to the bathroom

-is afraid of automatic water dispenser and has made herself completely dehydrated, I have placed a new water bowl out.

-we got a lab/husky mix dog as a companion for her and as he gets bigger, it seems to get worse

-she steals from the other dog  and obsesses over bones, to the point of urinating on herself and completely attacking you if you go near it, I use bbq tongs to take the treats away as I caught her staring at it for 3 hours. Once the treat is gone, she is sane again.

-I can give her treats that are smaller and she eats them pretty quick. However, if she is scared, like when she goes outside to go potty, she will not take a treat.

Basically, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt really afford a psychiatrist for her so I have to figure out if I can train her out of it. I have devised a small plan that may assist and I‚Äôm asking this subreddit for any advice or any resources I can reach out to. At this point, I fear she is going to cause harm to herself living like she is.

My plan-

-thundervest on at all waking hours
-anxiety pill every morning when I wake up, purchased from amazon
-sit outside with her for an hour a day with treats while I do homework, try giving her treats to get her used to cars driving by, air conditioning etc.
-take a 15-30 min walk each night before bed.
-separate dogs when given a special dinner or treat


The dog recognizes me as authority and cowers when I snap my finger on her. I have never physically or mentally hurt an animal, so this is not the case with her. 

Anyway, I have considered giving her to a rescue or finding an older couple that can shower her with love and attention,  but any time I look at a rescue website, I flood with tears because I love my dog. But I cannot have her suffering. Thanks for ready and have a wonderful day.

Or, if you don't want to click:

One gorgeous summer morning, I watched from across the pool as a small grey bird fluttered down out of a tree and hovered just a few feet in front of my foster dog, Quinn. Quinn tilted her head to the side and froze for a brief moment before lunging forward and snatching it from the air, issuing a neck-breaking shake, and then tossing it aside‚Äîall in one quick movement. She nudged it with her nose once or twice before continuing her sniffari in the pachysandra, as I stood there wondering about the absence of this bird‚Äôs self-preservation. I did not wonder about Quinn‚Äôs behavior. Quinn is a dog, and dogs are predators. More accurately, they are scavengers and predators.

We tend to forget this about dogs. We easily accept predatory behavior in cats for some reason, marveling at the ‚Äúgood little hunter‚Äù that dropped the decapitated mouse at our feet while we washed dishes. We might find it unpalatable, but we rarely classify it as a moral fail, nor worry the cat is deviant and a potential threat to people. We don‚Äôt mistakenly assign labels like ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù to our rodent-killing cats. But cats hunt and sometimes kill vermin and birds for the exact same reason our dogs do: preinstalled software that comes with our companion animals from a time when food acquisition skills were necessary for survival.

Yet every year, once spring has sprung, my social media newsfeed blows up with posts from dog owners, upset‚Äîoften angry‚Äîat their canine companions‚Äô leisurely killing of all manner of critter. ‚ÄúThanks a lot, Fido, you jerk! I‚Äôm so mad at him right now!‚Äù reads the script above the photograph of a broken bodied chipmunk. And I get it. It‚Äôs traumatizing to many of us. After all, most of us who share our homes with an animal are animal lovers, and so it saddens and upsets us to see any of them meet an end in our own back yards. 

I remember feeling horrified years ago when my Tuck was still young and fast enough to successfully dispatch the squirrels that dared to run our fence line. He‚Äôd spot them from the deck and stalk slowly and quietly to the foot of the stairs. He‚Äôd flat run to the fence, leap up and slam his body against whatever panel the squirrel had made it to, causing it to lose its footing. He would catch it in his mouth as it fell, shake it dead immediately, and then run a victory lap around the yard with the limp body dangling from his mouth. Tuck was having a gleeful time while I was worrying that somewhere out there was a nest of orphaned squirrel babies.

I also occasionally receive emails from clients and friends after these events, the owners worried this means their dog is dangerous. Could this ‚Äúaggression‚Äù be extrapolated to the dog‚Äôs behavior toward people? ‚ÄúThe answer is no,‚Äù I attempt to normalize, ‚Äúbecause this isn‚Äôt aggression. It‚Äôs a feeding behavior, and it‚Äôs as normal as a gull scooping fish from the sea or a fox pouncing on a field mouse.‚Äù Yes, they use those teeth, but if we classify this behavior as ‚Äúassault,‚Äù we need to recognize that we, too, assault our breakfast every morning. But assaulting our over-easies doesn‚Äôt make us likely to pummel our coworkers or neighbors.

When dogs direct aggressive behavior at people, it is typically in one of these contexts: stranger fear, body handling discomfort, or resource guarding. In all three cases, the objective is to increase distance: ‚ÄúStay away from me‚Äù or ‚Äústay away from my super important stuff.‚Äù In the case of predation, the goal is to get closer and to actually obtain the stimulus. Put simply, it‚Äôs just a biological imperative triggered by prey objects or objects resembling prey.

I recently saw a meme with a picture of a Boxer that read, ‚ÄúSquirrels are just tennis balls thrown by God.‚Äù While quite funny, it‚Äôs really the reverse. Tennis balls are just artificial squirrels thrown by man. It‚Äôs because they simulate prey fleeing that dogs chase them. Predation is the reason dogs grab, shake, and often ‚Äúdisembowel‚Äù stuffed toys. It‚Äôs why tug is so exciting and a preferred activity for many dogs: the tug toy simulates struggling prey. In fact, when played with a set of rules, it‚Äôs an excellent outlet for this activity and a fantastic impulse control exercise. If the drive to engage in predation for objects that resemble prey is so great, imagine how triggering a real live prey stimulus must be for our dogs!

Dogs also rehearse feeding behavior in play by chasing, along with all the other skills they need to function in the world, like fleeing (being chased), fighting (roughhousing), and fornicating (mounting). We see this rehearsal in play in early puppyhood and throughout their lives.

Some may ask why dogs feel compelled to hunt if we‚Äôre already feeding them plenty. While selection pressures are lifted for food acquisition in domesticated dogs, it hasn‚Äôt been very long since dogs were domesticated. From an evolutionary perspective, it‚Äôs just been a blink of an eye. Just because the pressure to get it right isn‚Äôt there, doesn‚Äôt mean it goes away entirely in such short order.

David Mech organized the predatory sequence of wolves as search, stalk, rush/chase, grab/bite, kill, dissect, and eat. It‚Äôs safe to assume that one-hundred percent of canids in the natural world that actually live to adulthood get this sequence right, because those that don‚Äôt will not live long enough to pass on their genetic flaw of poor hunting skills. In other words, there is a life-or-death pressure to get it right when no one is providing you kibble. 

Not so for domesticated dogs, which is why we see only partial versions of predation, or the software gets a bit buggy and is triggered by inanimate objects like squeaky toys. With the selection pressure lifted, they might not complete the entire predation sequence. They may chase, but not grab; chase and grab and shake, but not dissect or eat (like Quinn and Tuck); and so on. But predatory behaviors persist because they once had adaptive significance, and boy is survival ever significant!

Dogs that engage in predatory behavior are just behaving in a way that is normal for their species. For that matter, we humans are also just animals behaving in a way that is normal for our species. It‚Äôs normal for us to feel upset about a young bunny being killed, and it‚Äôs even normal for us to feel a bit frightened when we see our dogs use their sharp teeth in this way (there is an evolutionary reason for this, as well). As my primary and favorite mentor, Jean Donaldson, once said, ‚ÄúWe are all just animals. Animal behaving.‚Äù And we behave in a way that is natural for our species.

So while I empathize with upset owners, I have great sympathy for the dogs that are often punished‚Äîeven if by verbal berating (and sometimes by painful tools like shock)‚Äîmerely for being normal dogs. They have no idea why their owners are suddenly so upset with them.

I hope it helps people to step back and view these events for what they really are and find some patience and understanding for their pet dogs. They are not morally deficient for chasing and sometimes killing the critters that happen across our lawns. They aren‚Äôt a species with moral capability. We simply chose to co-habitate with an animal that comes with some degree of hunting software. We can give ourselves a break for feeling bummed about it sometimes, but we do well to recognize our natural differences and give them a break, too.",[Link] Predation and Dogs - Normalizing Behavior,dogs

He is less than a year old and my own pup just turned 3 and we've had him since he was born and I've watched many puppies so I had an idea what I was getting into. 

I had no idea this one puppy in particular would be so stressful. His owners raved about how well behaved he is and mentioned he can be a menace. Alright, no big deal, it's a puppy so it makes sense. 

The issue is that either they don't know or it's never come up before that he has severe separation anxiety.

No matter what I do, he constantly whines and goes to their bedroom door to keep pushing on the handle hoping they are in there. He's not allowed in there, or on the furniture, so I can't just let him go lay on their stuff. 

And he paces and needs to be constantly on top of you. Honestly the main issue is his biting. He still has the puppy nibbling which is worse than any other puppy I've taken care of before.

1576,"The last two weeks have been an emotional roller coaster. Fourteen days ago, almost to the hour as I write this, I was out visiting a friend who has acreage and a fair number of animals. I had my ten-year-old daughter with me, along with my 8-month-old female saluki. The two of them were playing outside on a big dirt mound with the dog on a short lead. A smaller dog ran past and my dog gave chase, came to the end of the lead in mid-air, and fell badly, breaking her leg and turning an otherwise pleasant day into a nightmare.

She cried and cried, and it took a while to figure out what the damage was. A broken foreleg about 2/3 up the radius/ulna bones. The only thing to do was to take her to the emergency after-hours vet and pay the exorbitant fees they charge to examine a dog. 

The doctor sat down to give us the bad news. With a broken leg, the standard treatment is looking to be in the 3-5 *thousand* dollar range. And for those who cannot afford it, amputation is an option. The vet tried to explain to me that this was ""perfectly humane"", but she has obviously never had a saluki.

Naturally, emotions ran high and my normally rational daughter had become unglued, feeling like she ruined our dog's life. We had a nice talk afterward and I explained the nature of accidents. But things were looking quite grim. Hundreds of dollars for sedation and x-ray and immobilization options that all looked like terrible ideas. I consented for them to take the x-ray so we could at least see what we were dealing with.

Out in the parking lot, I called my breeder. I don't know why I didn't call him first. It would have saved some hassle. But he was genuinely surprised to hear of the broken leg. He said in his 70 years and hundreds of salukis and whippets that he's never ever had a broken leg. He just couldn't believe this would have happened. And really, it was a freak accident. He told me if it was him he'd get the dog out of there and let her rest overnight and then take her to a greyhound specialist in the morning.

So I got the resolve to go with his gut instinct rather than the professional medical advice. I went in and paid my bill for services rendered. The vet confirmed that the leg was broken and wrapped it up (charging $90 for the wrap) and we were on our way home.

I had to carry the dog (very carefully) everywhere. It was extremely tricky. But we did manage to get her to this greyhound guy, who is a very old and very eccentric fellow. At first, he didn't think it was broken at all. He felt all over the leg and gave her some injections to help with healing. He confirmed it was broken and said it should be fine if we keep her calm. I was to come back after a week or so.

The next week was a real nightmare. She rested somewhat comfortably for most of it while I carried her to go potty or go in her crate or whatever she needed. She spent a lot of time in her  rather nice wire crate with blankets. It was a miserable time. At least three of the days, she had a panic attack as she moved badly and it hurt. I was about ready to take her to a vet and maybe have a cast put on. But the vet I needed to go see was out of town and I figured I'd make it through the weekend and see how she does.

Finally, on the 2nd week she started to get into a rhythm with how to lay without pain. I put her leg in a cardboard paper towel core for stability, and it worked remarkably well. That way, if she held the leg at a certain angle, its weight wouldn't put too much pressure on the break. I also found that she was fine on her right side but not on her left, and that the break was definitely not displaced or even in two pieces. Likely a ""greenstick"" fracture. It still moves, but only one way and the sharp pains seem to have ended.

By Sunday, just two days ago, she went through a sudden transformation. Suddenly, it was like she was back to normal and happy and playful. I have no idea what happened, but she is doing great. You would never know she had a broken leg apart from the fact that she doesn't *use* that leg, and she has gained quite a lot of skill loping around outside on three legs. I'm astounded at the sudden acceleration in recovery. I didn't expect to get to this phase for another two weeks or so.

Her muscles have wasted away a fair bit unfortunately, from a week of no use. But people tell me they will recover in time. Now, she's actually eager to play and be active and seems to know how to not hurt herself. She has had zero complaints despite her bouncing around. I'm concerned of course. I don't want her being *too* active, and I am watching her like a hawk to make sure she doesn't get herself into trouble.

I've tried to research online how long the healing process is for this kind of injury for that age of dog. Everything I've read says it'll take at least six weeks, possibly up to twelve before she can put weight on it and start to use it. And people tell me *not* to let her do any kind of strenuous running for maybe six months or so, which is an awfully long wait.

I'm curious if anyone here has gone through the process of nursing a dog back to health from a broken leg *without* the help of a vet. I did take her back to the greyhound guy, who only charges like $25 per visit. He says she's healing great and to stop worrying. Says she'll make a full recovery.

Is it possible that this was simply a *slight* fracture? Minor enough that it will somehow heal much faster than most? I'm not sure what to think of this, but I'm quite relieved that she appears to be happy and on the way to a recovery... without having to spend several thousand dollars in vet bills.",[discussion] Broken leg - amazing recovery so far,dogs
1577,"I have 2 dogs, an old champ (adopted several years ago), and a newly adopted rescue (1.5 years), which I've had for 3 weeks.  She's doing great with potty training (was from a hoarding situation, so she wasn't potty trained) and hasn't had an accident in a week.  She's normally pretty good at going fairly quickly once we get out, but it depends on how long since the last walk.  I find that if it's been say, 5 hours, unlike my 10 yr old boy, she isn't dying to go, so she might not go right away (she must be able to hold her bladder longer).  I just spent 20 or so minutes outside trying to get her to go for a quick bedtime potty at 10pm.  My boy of course went right away.  There's lots of grassy areas around my house.

1578,"So, my usually happy dog displayed aggression towards a particular person today. before I get into the situation, I feel I need to give background about this person.

so, this older man began bringing his dog to the dog park while we were taking a multi month break from going (issues related to my wife's health and my work schedule. luckily we have a huge back yard). Upon our return to regularly scheduled long visits to the dog park where our dog is well known and loved by the regulars, we learned of this man raising a fuss claiming that another owners dog (Loki) attacked his dog ""brutally"". Now Loki would NEVER do such a thing, and witnesses have said it wasn't true. While we weren't there (obviously), we can tell that due to the dogs age, loki was likely getting annoyed at the man's dog and just gave him a warning lunge, as dogs do in order to verbalise their annoyance and to send a message. nothing more. This is normal behavior. Loki has even done it to our dog who is friends with him as she deserved it, and then things were right in the world. Loki just likes to chill typically in one spot. So, this guy raised a fuss. he called animal control and park rangers, claiming that poor Loki brutally mauled his dog (funny it was less than a week after that we started going back and his dog was absolutely fine). This is not only annoying for obvious reasons, but the fact that Loki's owner is the reason the dog park doesn't fall into disrepair ( a fact that this old man who just started coming is ignorant to). He is always the one that pesters parks and rec to repair items and to actually enforce rules, and he is always bringing tools and dirt and whatnot to repair holes in the ground and fences when the parks dept. won't.

Now, the second day we went to the park (the next day) the old man picked me to jabber to all day. Without never meeting me before, the first thing out of his mouth was how terrible Loki and his owner was. Without realizing we are both friends with Loki's owner and aware of the situation he starts spewing lies about them. Then it got really bizarre as he starting telling us about how he was trained in some obscure martial art and that he was gonna ""surprise"" Loki's owner and ""beat the hell out of him"". I'm thinking that this is bizarre talk from an older wealthier man. from then on he wouldn't let me listen to other conversations (including with my wife), continued making awkward inappropriate jokes , and the MOST infuriating thing was that while we had our other dog at the vet getting neutered, my wife got a call from the vet ( he knew that it was) and when my wife hung up the phone and I went to ask my wife about what they said, he kept interrupting her to tell me more abrasive jokes as if she didn't matter (this becomes slightly more important in a bit)

This was made worse the next day when we were sitting with Loki's owner, and a group of people (less frequent than most of us regulars who know Loki) were on the other side of the dog park and it was quite apparent that the jerks rumors about poor Loki were spreading.

Now, before I talk about today, I will describe my dog. My dog is hyper (calming down with age. she is almost two), playful, non threatening, and friendly to a fault ( this caused her a rather expensive and heart breaking injury earlier in her life. a dog we were taking her to meet bit her good. The owner, desperate to find this dog a home lied to my wife saying that the dog loved other dogs and was socialised. After the bite it turned to ""he's never been around another dog before"" magically. that is freaking irresponsible. sorry. off topic). She always runs around and greets everybody and every dog in the park and has a ball. for HOURS, by the way. it's crazy. It is important to note that she has NEVER shown aggression towards anyone in her life.

Now today, many of the dogs left, and it was just our dog and his. He is yammering on, including saying to my wife that if it were up to him that he would never work for another woman again because they are bipolar (his words. not mine). Now, while my wife and I strongly dislike the man, I just nod along to whatever he is saying.

Then, his dog was eating dirt right next to my wife, and was not listening to him tell her to stop. When he got up to go towards his dog, all of the sudden, my dogs mood shifted as if to protect me and my wife. She started showing teeth, growling, barking aggressively (as opposed to her play bark), pacing back and forth in front of us while watching him, and the strangest part which is one part of my question, had her head down and tilted as if there was something in her ear (if that makes sense) we had to keep calling her back. Now, the moron, while fully aware that my dog changed her posture towards him, kept moving forward. his dog had already ran elsewhere, yet this jerk was now trying to approach our dog, while my wife and I are trying to calm our dog down, showing that we didn't need protection. My dogs aggression kept switching back to play when his dog approached her, and turned to happy when we were holding and petting her and reassuring her. Then he produced a treat, which I asked him not to give it to her, but my wife decided it was fine. so my dog happily ate the treat, but then resumed her aggression towards him. We decided it was time to leave, because the old guy was just not getting the picture that our dog all of the sudden didn't like him.

My questions are these: 1. While I know dogs can sense how there owners feel about things and people, I feel like I didn't outwardly show signs of discomfort, as I try to be polite. Are dogs just THAT good at sensing their owners feelings, or could it have been something else about him? 2. While my dog showed aggression towards him, she tilted her head oddly. What was that about?

I didn't scold her for it. It definitely seemed like she felt like she needed to protect us, and I trust her over this guy. we just calmed her down positively, as we don't want her to think that warning us about potential threats is bad. I just wish the guy got the hint after our dogs display. Of all people in the park, he is the last person we want her messing with.

I think it is of note that even in the middle of the situation, my dogs demeanor completely switched back to normal when the guys dog tried to play with her.

Sorry this is so long, but it was strange! 

Edit: I should also say my dog showed no signs of ear irritation before or after, as that could have been otherwise a sign of why she was head tilting.",[Help] Random unusual aggression towards a specific person.,dogs

1581,"\[throwaway account\]

A little backstory: my grandmother lives with me and we have always owned dogs. With the exception of one who we stole from her friend because she was being neglected, they have all been either bought from a backyard breeder or from a pet store. Once I grew up and educated myself on dog adoption and started volunteering for animal shelters, I pledged to never purchase an animal and instead rescue. Since I am a full time student and work two jobs AND take care of my grandmother, I didn't have time for an actual pet, so when my dogs died, I settled for fostering kittens. My grandmother HATED cats at the time, but it was my belief that it's my house and if she has a problem, she can always move out and live with her sons and not her granddaughter. I fell in love with the cats; they were so much easier to take care of than dogs and once my last foster litter left, I decided to adopt an adult cat (his name is Abraham DeLacey, Giuseppe Casey Thomas O'Malley, but we call him Giuseppe).  I chose an adult instead of a kitten because I knew I didn't have the time or responsibility for a kitten. My cat is not only family to me, but my therapist and psychiatrist made him an emotional support animal for me; I have a mental disability and my cat keeps me calm. At this point, my grandmother tolerated the cat, but she was very upset at the death of our Yorkie and desperately wanted another dog, specifically a yorkie puppy. My cat is very low-maintenance; he is fine with free-feeding, so I basically only need to clean his litter and refill his food/water. The only exception is that he has very bad anxiety, so he has to be on Prozac (which happens to be one of the medications I am on! It was meant to be lol). Even though my grandmother started to love Giuseppe, she still wanted a new puppy. I told her I don't have time to take care of puppies (since they are a full-time job) and I really don't want to be responsible for something so high-maintenance. I love dogs, truly, but I don't have time to train or walk a dog every couple hours. And, not to be morbid, but my grandmother will die soon, which will leave me with a dog that I don't have time for. Not only is that unfair to me, but it is unfair to the dog. Also important to mention: my dogs all died very young. I wasn't their primary caretaker (as in I didn't feed them nor walk them), so I didn't have much control over anything, but I know my grandmother would feed them scraps of food, often food with garlic and onions. I knew this was bad for the dogs and told her to quit it (sososososo many times), but she refused to listen. The dogs died around 7-9. One from suspected kidney failure and one from diabetes. I don't know if the table scraps led to their death, but I know it didn't help. Luckily, my cat hates all food except one specific brand of cat food, so I don't have table scrap problems with the cat.  I always figured my grandmother would buy a dog behind my back, so I highly advised she adopted if she was going to do so. I found hundreds of small dogs nearby and told her about the shelter I volunteer at and how wonderful adopting is compared to buying, but I truly truly did not have time for a dog, let alone a puppy, so I told her no multiple times. 

Fast forward a couple months later and.....she decided to buy a thousand dollar puppy from a backyard breeder. Behind my back. In my own house. Under the excuse that if I can have a cat (in my own house mind you!), she can have a dog. I don't care about your personal opinions on breeders vs shelters, but to me, it is despicable to buy from/support a person who abuses animals for profit. My grandmother never checked the breeder's background history, never met the mother dog or did anything to see if this was a good breeder. Not only that, but I am being left with a 2-month old puppy, who I have to train, vaccinate, spay, socialize, feed, care for, etc. when I am a full time student who works two jobs! I know my grandmother cannot care for this puppy. It took her SIX HOURS to even buy real food for the darn thing! I was the one who told her that she should feed her real puppy food instead of turkey scraps from the fridge (and lord knows what kind of spices and onions/garlic was on it) and the cat's food. The puppy had to pee, so my grandmother took her out, without a leash (because she didn't buy her a leash), which is a) illegal in my area and b) SOSOSO beyond dangerous! She is not microchipped, nor did my grandmother buy her a collar/identification and she doesn't have any flea/tick preventative! My cat rarely goes outside yet he has a collar with extensive identification, a microchip and flea/tick preventative AND he only goes out on a leash! And he's a cat! She didn't buy the puppy dishes, a bed, any toys, a collar, a leash, a crate, food, treats, grooming supplies or ANYTHING you need to take care of a dog. The puppy STILL hasn't been to a single vet visit! She has NO paperwork from the breeder; her paperwork is literally a piece of paper saying ""Congrats on buying a dog!"" When I adopted my cat, I got a BOOK of paperwork, detailing every event of my cat's life until he ended up in the shelter. The parent's information, their breed history, the health of the parents, breed registration, vet records were never provided from the breeder. My grandmother also knows zero English, so I have to be the one to take the puppy to the vet and to obedience courses. Not to mention that I just got my cat's anxiety under control and now he's back to hissing and peeing everywhere. Giuseppe is super territorial and I knew getting another animal would be a terrible idea (I had thought about fostering kittens again, but knew that Giuseppe would not be okay with that). I am beyond frustrated with my grandmother. I want to provide this puppy with the best life possible, but it is so hard when every time I look at the pup, I feel nothing but frustration &amp; anger at my grandmother. I love dogs, but I simply don't have the time nor the energy to look after a puppy. My grandmother will die soon and I will be left with a dog I never wanted to begin with. Does anyone have any advice to not only raising a puppy (which I have never done, but I work at a vet clinic where half the clients are people having issues with their puppies, so I know the amount of time, effort and energy go into raising one), but dealing with my frustration towards my grandmother? I also don't know how to deal with socializing my cat with severe anxiety with the dog. My grandmother got the dog when I was away so she literally just threw the dog into my house without any prior separation and let her harass and chase around my cat the whole time I was away. (She thinks that the cat 'wagging' his tail is happiness and that him hitting the pup across the face when she's bothering him is playing. It's not.) Thanks in advance!

1585,"We went to a nearby kite festival on a beach this weekend, with my 13 month old BC/Lab/Husky mix.

At some points, she was even watching the nearby kites as closely as we were, with not even a lip lick of concern.

She took a Canine Good Citizen class a few months ago, but failed the test (twice) because she was too anxious and just shut down. But, in this crazy environment, surrounded by hundreds of people and several barking dogs, and walking on a texture she's never seen before, she just demoed almost every single CGC skill perfectly.

1588,"Hi, I am a 19yr old female living out of  home. I currently live in a share house in which we have decided on a no  pets policy, so if I were to get a dog I would obviously need to move  to another residency. Where I live there are laws being passed that  prevent landlords from having a no pets policy, and from what I have  read one can only be evicted over a pet if there is a good reason for  it, e.g. if it does significant damage to the property, just as you can  be evicted for doing significant damage yourself.

With that out of the way, I would likely move to another share-house type situation.

At  my Mum's place where I grew up, we always had many pets. At the moment  there are two dogs (Poodle and Shetland Sheepdog), two cats and two  birds. Whilst I have always lived with dogs, my mum has always been ""pack leader"" and taken responsibility for walking/training/grooming etc. It has been a year since I moved and whilst I go back often, I seriously miss the presence of a dog in my home. I know that a dog is a  big responsibility and I would never ever want to give my dog up (a dog  is for life!), so I want to be sure that if I do get a dog then I will  be able to look after it.

I really love  working dogs (sheepdogs) and also larger breeds like German Shepherds. I like dogs that are intelligent.

1596,"Hey everyone, sorry if it‚Äôs too long...

I have a small doggo and he is six months old and I feel like he‚Äôs got the tiniest bladder in the world. I‚Äôve read that a dog can hold their pee for a while but I feel like he pees 50 times a day. He‚Äôs a healthy boy with no problems. He knows how to pee and poop outside. However, he still pees inside the house. I even have wee pads everywhere in case I can‚Äôt catch him while peeing. Sometimes he just stands there and before I realize it, there‚Äôs a tiny pee puddle. Sometimes he just walks around and pees at the same time. Or if I catch him peeing and I‚Äôm trying to rush over to him, I try to interrupt him by clapping and saying ‚ÄúStop‚Äù and he starts to move and continues peeing so I see a really long pee line in the carpet.

It‚Äôs driving me nuts and i dont know how many odor eliminating sprays I bought and went through. I really want this to stop. My older dog (1 yr) is doing fine and isnt doing any of this inside the house and he‚Äôs even bell trained so he rings the bell to go outside and pee/poop. I was hoping the smaller one would see that and learn from it(monkey see monkey do) and I even tried bell training him but he wont ring the bell or do anything to let me know he wants to pee. 

I‚Äôve tried crate training but it‚Äôs not great because his pee puddles are small and he can just go to a corner and pee there. If i leave the room, he starts screaming from inside the crate. I mean screaming as in top of his lungs screaming and he won‚Äôt stop until I come back. I‚Äôve tried putting in toys, treats, and one of my shirts but it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried ignoring it but he won‚Äôt stop and it starts to give me a headache if it goes on for a long time

I‚Äôve tried leash training where I have him on leash and keep him close to me at all time but because I am doing something else at same time, he just gnaws on the leash and I don‚Äôt want him to break it. 

I‚Äôve tried putting him outside once every 30 mins in hopes he‚Äôll pee but sometimes it‚Äôs successful and sometimes it‚Äôs not. Sometimes he‚Äôll run around, pee, and then ask to go back inside. Sometimes he‚Äôll just go on his two feet and scratch at the door (it‚Äôs his way of asking to go back in) and won‚Äôt stop for ages. I‚Äôve tried ignoring it and waited around but he has gone on for about 15 mins straight just scratching the door. If i let him back in, he gnaws on his chew toys and then before I know it, there‚Äôs a pee puddle so it makes me frustrated and makes me feel like he does it on purpose.

1604,"Hi there!



I have been surrounded by animals my entire life, but I have never owned a dog as an adult. I have wanted to adopt, but my partner wasn't so sure. So we compromised and decided to foster. 



Long story short, it wasn't very well coordinated and I showed up not knowing which dog I was getting.



They gave me Exhilia, 4 months old believed to be a boxer/Australian Shepard mix. From what I was told, she was found on a reservation in Alabama with her siblings as strays. They were covered in ticks, fleas, and scabs. She was bussed up to us over a two-day drive, and when I received her she hadn't eaten since the day before. 



So on Day 1 I renamed her Meeko. I gave her a blanket, pillow and some food for the hour-long drive back to my home. When we got home we took her for a walk in our courtyard and attempted to bring her to the apartment. She didn't seem to know how to use stairs or doesn't like to. She was terrified of the elevator and the doors, so I carried her. This probably wasn't the best introduction but when we got in, I had my cat look at the dog as I held her, he stared and I set her down. Meeko tried to play with my cat right away, he wasn't having it, he just hissed and tried to keep his distance. Meeko was cautious but it was clear she wanted to play. She explored the apartment which is when we discovered She was scared of mirrors and terrified of the tv. We turned the TV off and she explored our apartment and played some more. She did have an accident in the living room which we ignored and cleaned up. Before bed we took her out one more time, but she did not relieve herself.



I gave her a pillow, blankets and toys for her crate which we placed in the bathroom connected to our bedroom. We placed puppy pads down and a baby gate to keep her in during the night. When I got home it was already 7, so we took her for a walk, 



On the morning of Day 2 around 7 am I woke up to a smell, because Meeko had relieved herself on the puppy pads. (1 &amp; 2). I am not sure if it is the food, the stress or the fact that she is a puppy but she has had diarrhea. We were provided with Diamond brand food for puppies and expecting mothers. The bag recommends 3 cups a day. 

After cleaning up I brought her outside, she relieved herself again after some running (#2). She was eating and drinking like normal. I was taking her out once an hour to try and get her to potty. It's been hit or miss, in the apartment she has used the puppy pads, and if we catch her sniffing we run her out. She slept most of the day, and discovered she can fit under the bed. In an effort to make her more comfortable and to puppy proof the area, we closed off one side, and created a small under the bed cave for her. For the most part, she stays under the bed, lays in her crate or lays next to the bed. She will not go in the living room when the TV is on. When the TV is off she will try to play with the cat, run around for a bit, then go under the bed again. She listens when we say ""heeey"", or ""No"". She doesn't seem to know her name.

She is getting better about walking through doors and being on the elevator but she runs when I try to put the leash on her to go outside and will not willingly leave our apartment, she has to be picked up and carried to the elevator. While in our apartment she will sometimes whine, not AT anything in particular, just general crying. I assume she is just freaked out by all this stuff she doesn't recognize.

I try to give her attention and affection, but for the most part, she wants to be left alone it seems.

Today is day 3. I woke up at 2 am (either puppy mom senses or I have a sensitive nose) she had relieved herself on the puppy pad (diarrhea again). She seemed happy to see me in the bathroom while I was cleaning up. I gave her a quick hello, laid out new pads and went back to bed. 

This morning I brought her out, she didn't relieve herself. When we got back in I fed her half of her food for the day. While I was getting ready I watched her, she relieved herself on a puppy pad in our living room (#1) (Where she had her first accident on night one). I noticed her sniffing around more so I brought her outside where she relived herself again (#2). I left her in the bathroom with the light off and the baby gate up at 7:30. My partner came home after I left and let her outside before he left for work around 9.




Today is our first days back at work. My partner brought her out on lunch, she hadn't relieved herself at all while we were away. When he brought her out, he said she seemed happy to see him. She did #2 (still diarrhea)  but not #1. We have taken away her food while we are gone, but leave the water in case she is dehydrated from diarrhea. 


At this time my main concern is potty training her and just acclimating her to her new surroundings, and us. I try to give her space, but I desperately want to love her. Should this be my main focus or should I be doing more?



She still seems very overwhelmed, for a puppy she rarely wants to play. She is getting better about using doors and the elevator (as I think she is realizing that is how she gets outside). I am not sure she knows her name yet, and while she does walk on a leash, she doesn't seem to realize she is on one because she is always under my feet and wrapping herself around things. 



She also doesn't like to go outside, I have to pick her up in order to put the leash on and get her to leave our unit.

My boyfriend and I share a house with my dad and two roommates. My boyfriend and I have a husky mix named Victor and the roommates have a sharpay/shepard mix named Nova. A few days ago my boyfriend was at work, and I had taken my dad to a job interview. Someone, we're not sure who, accidentally left the garage door open and when one of the roommates went in the garage both dogs bolted. He managed to grab Nova, but Victor is a lot faster and he got out. Roommate tried to coax him back with food, but he was too interested in running and sniffing lawns. 

As soon as Victor didn't respond Roommate called me, who happened to be right around the corner, arriving back home. I start to freak out, because usually when he gets out he has so much fun getting chased it takes hours to get him home. Last time it took him getting clipped by a car for him to stop and let us take him (he was totally fine, just scared silly). Usually when he gets out I chase him for a while, eventually catch him, give him a quick couple spanks and a ""BAD BOY"", and then pick him up and try not to cry with relief while I take him home.

This time though, I got home, roommate pointed the direction he'd gone, and almost as soon as I turned to walk after Victor he saw me and ran right back to the house. Not to the garage where he escaped from, the front door where we leave and enter from walks. He did some tippy taps waiting for me to open the door. I went to grab him in case he decided to run again, and he flinched expecting the normal Escape Spanks.

Which I didn't give him. I let him in and gave him hugs and pets and a treat for running right to me and the house. If he immediately came back every time he got out I wouldn't be as worried if he does, so the last thing I wanted to do at that moment was punish him. My boyfriend disagrees though, he feels that since Victor escaped he deserved a punishment as soon as he was secure, end of story. I maintained that coming right back made him a good boy deserving of praise.

1612,"My new female German Shorthaired Pointer puppy is now 11 weeks old and is settling in beautifully. We've had her since 8 weeks old.

I wouldn't say 'love' yet, but they definitely like being with each other. 

He is very patient with her, and she is VERY annoying, as I assume most puppies are. We only let them be together when I can watch them 100% of the time. Otherwise, she is gated with me in the kitchen while he has the rest of the house.

The problem is, *I* don't love her the way I feel like I'm ""supposed"" to and overall I feel like I made a huge mistake getting a dog.

1621,"So my dog has, over the last two years anyway, grown increasingly hostile towards the Vet. She's required a muzzle, but that seems to make thing worse. She's even turned on me in the exam room. It's basically fight or flight.


They gave her five differing dosages of sedatives and none made a large enough effect to get her to even lay down. It's becoming insane to deal with and both the Vet and I are at our wits end.


I took the dog home and after all those sedatives, she was stumbling around but still trying to run around the yard. Our dog trainer once pegged her as a ""control-freak"" and I feel like she refuses to go down for the count with all the sedatives. 


It's worth noting this dog has zero discipline issues, loves people, loves meeting new people, she's very well trained and has gone through numerous levels of obedience school. Once she enters the exam room though, all training goes out the window and her primal instincts kick in. ",[Help] My dog hates the vet. Sedation doesn't help/work!,dogs

1623,"I've been watching [these off-grid camping youtube videos](https://youtu.be/3wNAkqbLVpA?t=1429) lately, where the guy goes out in the middle of nowhere and builds a shelter out of wood that he cuts down from dead trees, etc etc. He brings his dog, german shepherd, who has a lot of energy and loves sticks.

I would love to do something like this. I've thought about off-grid camping, but in general it would be awesome just to explore in nature alone with my dog without having him on a leash and without worrying that he'll run somewhere and I won't be able to find him .. (for clarification - somewhere with no people)

He is *very* much attached to me and our bond is incredible. He's fairly well-trained, but he's easily distracted by squirrels, people, etc. That's my main concern that he'll run after a squirrel and there's no telling how far he'll chase. His recall is good unless he sees a squirrel.

I live around Dallas TX , where land is abundant..but a lot of it is already owned (people/govt) and barbed wired off so it's really hard to know where I'm allowed to go and where it would be safe to practice to see how close he'd stay to me.

Any suggestions?",How are you suppose to know if your dog is cable of being off-leash in a state forest or very rural areas? [help],dogs

I have a question about weird stuff on my dog his ears. We've only noticed the recently. He's an English Cocker Spaniel, about 1 year old.

Here's a picture:

It looks a bit like dandruff, but thicker. It's stuck together and we have to brush it to get it to loosen up a bit. He doesn't have pain and it doesn't seem to annoy him (although brushing does) so we haven't been to the vet or a trimmer. We've tried washing it off but that doesn't work.

1629,"I have been looking to adopt a dog over the last couple weeks but have been having quite a bit of difficulty in working with rescues to adopt a dog.

First rescue I contacted looked at my application and promptly scheduled a meet and greet. Unfortunately, the rescue uses prong collars and adversive training techniques to get their rescue dogs to behave. That being said the dog did have a good temperament and had changed a lot based on their description of when the rescue received the dog. I am worried about supporting a rescue that uses adversive training and prong collars. They also didn't seem to spend much time with the dog even though it was there for 6 months (recovering from HW) as they didn't know if it knew basic obedience and never seemed to play with the dog at all, just take it for walks with groups of their other dogs. At the meet and greet I asked if they had any toys I could try playing with the dog with but they didn't have any. Also, the rescue was trying to convince me to adopt the dog with some poor reasons to adopt a dog. They did review my application very quickly which was nice. They tend to get a lot of a specific breed and are active in a breed specific Facebook page where everyone praises them. Yes they are doing a good job rescuing dogs that need homes but it is sad to see them using harsh and outdated training techniques and not really spending time with the dogs they have. I would understand not spending time with the dogs at a shelter but when they are in your own home that seems a bit odd. The only defense I could see for not spending time with the dogs is that the dogs could play with each other instead of with the humans and toys. The rescue is run out of someone's large property along with foster homes. The dog I was interested in was at the rescue, but I also saw another dog that was being adopting and was from a foster family that I think did spend more time with the dog as they didn't have a bunch of dogs in their house like the rescue.

Second attempt was adopting from a shelter but someone was coming from a nearby state to look at the dog that I was interested in. They didn't say anything about letting me see the dog later that weekend, but I understand not wanting to put that pressure on someone to adopt. They did suggest another dog that they were pulling from a shelter that weekend but I was not free when they wanted to meet. Dog is still available that I was originally interested in, but haven't been back to that area (3.5 hours by family) to follow up and setup a meeting.

Third attempt was rehoming a dog on adoptapet. I applied and was denied the next day. I'm guessing the dog was in the process of being adopted by someone else as the post disappeared the next weekend.

Fourth attempt is at another shelter which does regular adoption events. I saw a dog at an adoption event that I was interested but didn't end up being a good fit (low energy). After the event, I applied to see a couple different dogs that were not coming to adoption events, but my application has not been processed after a week. Seems pretty slow considering they adopt an average of 3 dogs per day. They were posting on their Facebook to apply for adoption if you wanted to adopt the next weekend with the Bissell Clear the Shelters event, and I had my application in before then. The dog I was interested in has been there a while and was part of the promotion, but after talking to a volunteer at one of their adoption events, apparently the foster family is very attached to the dog but doesn't want to adopt it themselves. The foster family will only adopt to the perfect family that probably doesn't exist. Maybe I will have better luck with one of the other dogs.

Trying to adopt has seemed a lot more effort than I expected. Do you guys think I have reasonable expectations of how a rescue operates? I totally get not doing same day adoptions but over a week to look at an application seems slow. Also should I be worried about the dog's previous training using harsh methods in the past? Maybe I should go back to the first rescue and look at one of the other dogs that I was also interested in, even though I disagree with their methods. Their dogs did seem to have good temperaments and were described truthfully.

I'd love to hear your guys if you guys have had similar struggles with rescues, shelters, and dog adoptions.

TLDR: Find a dog to adopt is hard.

Edit: Forgot about attempt 3.5. Tried contacted a dog owner directly from a courtesy post on petfinder for rehoming, and never got a response. I contacted the rescue, and it looks like the wrong phone number was posted on the post, so maybe that opportunity is still open.",[discussion][vent] Difficulties with rescues and shelters while trying to adopt a dog,dogs

1631,"This a tad of a weird question. To set the context, my pup and I go to a fenced in grassy area to play everyday. My pup is about 1 years old. There's another dog that goes occasionally who really likes playing with my dog. The dog and owner are both pretty nice. However, the dog looks pretty sick - skinny, pretty roughed up coat, his stool is firm but full of yellow splotches. I tried to inconspicuously ask the owner if the dog is up to date with shots and he said he is. However, based on the dog's appearance I'm not sure if the dog is healthy since he really doesn't look it, so I'm pretty uncomfortable letting my dog play with them. Redditors, have any of you run into something like this? If so, how did you handle it? I want to be sensitive to the owner but at the same time have my dog's best interests in mind.
